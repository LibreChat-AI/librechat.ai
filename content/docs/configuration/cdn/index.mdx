<Callout type="info" title="Note">
  LibreChat supports multiple file storage backends and one CDN option. Amazon S3 and Azure Blob Storage are object/file storage solutions, while Firebase is the only true CDN option with global edge delivery. Choose the one that best meets your deployment requirements.
