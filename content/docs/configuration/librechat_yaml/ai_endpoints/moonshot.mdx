**Notes:**

- **Known:** icon provided.
- **Important:** For models with reasoning/thinking capabilities (e.g., `kimi-k2.5`, `kimi-k2-thinking`), the endpoint `name` **must** be set to `"Moonshot"` (case-insensitive) for interleaved reasoning to work correctly with tool calls. Using a different name will result in errors like `thinking is enabled but reasoning_content is missing in assistant tool call message`. See [Moonshot's documentation](https://platform.moonshot.ai/docs/guide/use-kimi-k2-thinking-model#frequently-asked-questions) for more details.
