- Removed `stop` from OpenAI/custom endpoint default parameters
- Added `current_model` option for [`titleModel`](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/custom_endpoint#titlemodel) and [`summaryModel`](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/custom_endpoint#summarymodel) endpoint settings in order to use the active conversation's model for those methods.
