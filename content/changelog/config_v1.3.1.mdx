  - See [Web Search Configuration](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/web_search#firecrawlversion) for details

- Added `CONVERSATION_IMPORT_MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES` environment variable
  - Limits the maximum file size for conversation imports in bytes

  - See [Environment Variables](/docs/configuration/dotenv#conversation_import_max_file_size_bytes) for details

- Added optional `group` field to modelSpecs configuration
  - Organizes model specs in the UI selector with flexible grouping options
  - Three behaviors based on `group` value:
    - If `group` matches an endpoint name (e.g., "openAI", "groq"), the spec nests under that endpoint
    - If `group` is a custom name (doesn't match any endpoint), creates a separate collapsible section
    - If `group` is omitted, the spec appears as a standalone item at top level
  - See [Model Specs](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/model_specs#group) for details
