# LibreChat Turns 3!

LibreChat officially turned 3 on February 11th! 🎉🥳

I'm incredibly grateful to everyone who's contributed, whether through feedback, code, or just showing up and using the project.

## 2025 in Review

Before looking ahead, let's take stock of what we accomplished in 2025 (see [last year's roadmap](/blog/2025-02-20_2025_roadmap)):

- Started the year at 22,200 GitHub stars, reaching **33,900+** as of writing
- Over **6,800 forks** and over 23 million container registry pulls
- Community Discord server grown to over **9,000 members**
- Major feature releases from v0.7.8 through **[v0.8.3-rc1](/changelog/v0.8.3-rc1)**
- Acquired by [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-acquires-librechat) to democratize AI-driven analytics

**Key feature milestones:**
- Multi-agent support through our app-agnostic [Agents framework](https://github.com/danny-avila/agents/)
- Native web search, OCR, inline Mermaid diagrams, pinned models/agents
- [Resumable chats](/docs/features/resumable_streams) preserving responses through disconnects, tab switches, and device changes
- Multimodal file support: video understanding, PDFs, native provider file handling
- [Image generation and editing](/docs/features/image_gen) with GPT-Image-1+ and Gemini (Nano Banana)
- [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) integrations, plus dynamic server management from the UI
- Sharing agents, prompts, and MCP servers between users, backed by Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- [User Memories](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/memory) for personalized context across conversations
- [OpenAI-compatible Agents API](/docs/features/agents_api) for external integrations and automation (in Beta)

## The 2026 Roadmap

This year, instead of a list of every possible feature, **we're focusing on just two quarters at a time**: Q1 and Q2. This keeps commitments honest, timelines realistic, and lets us adapt as the AI landscape continues to shift under everyone's feet.

We'll revisit and publish the H2 roadmap mid-year.

> Note: as always, bug fixes and smaller improvements ship continuously alongside roadmap work.

---

### Q1

Q1 has 2 major focus areas that will define LibreChat's next chapter.

---

#### Dynamic Context

The core insight for agentic workflows is simple: agents perform better when they pull context on demand. Less noise, fewer tokens, better results.

LibreChat already implements some patterns from the dynamic context playbook, but by the end of Q1, we're going deeper:

- **Agent Skills** ([#11106](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/issues/11106))
  - A new standard for domain-specific instructions and bundled resources
- **Programmatic Tool Calling (PTC)**
  - Code orchestration for tools, giving agents incredible flexibility of how tool outputs are interpreted
- **Conversation Summarization**
  - Intelligent context compression for long-running conversations, preserving key details while reclaiming token budget

The goal is LibreChat agents that are smarter about what they know and when they know it.

To power Skills and PTC, I will be open-sourcing the [Code Interpreter API](/docs/features/code_interpreter) by end of Q1, giving agents the ability to execute code in a safe and scalable way, tailored for LibreChat's implementation of these features.

Notable features already completed as part of Dynamic Context:
- [Event-driven lazy tool execution](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/pull/11588) for MCP tools
- [Deferred tool discovery](/docs/features/agents#deferred-tools) for Agents using MCP tools

- [Code mode](https://blog.cloudflare.com/code-mode/) by Cloudflare
- [Advanced Tool Use](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/advanced-tool-use) by Anthropic
- [My demo of Programmatic Tool Calling](https://youtu.be/5DUvTbntkAg?si=80c9J9fryLoVhYPy&t=515) from a recent ClickHouse event in NYC

---

#### Admin Panel

The v1 Admin Panel ([#3137](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/issues/3137)) requires four core capabilities:

- **GUI for Configuration**
  - A graphical interface for everything currently managed through `librechat.yaml`, eliminating the need to edit YAML files for most settings
- **Configuration Profiles**
  - Apply configuration profiles to roles initially, with group-level profiles as a stretch goal
- **Group & Role Management**
  - Create and manage groups and roles from the UI, with user management as a stretch goal
- **Access Controls Throughout**
  - Access controls embedded into every aspect of the admin panel, not bolted on after the fact

Once released, it will continue to be developed and iterated on, with new features and improvements added as needed.

> Note: The Admin Panel was scoped in 2025 but deprioritized in favor of revenue-critical features. After the ClickHouse acquisition, priorities shifted, but the feature first required a proper RBAC system capable of governing app-level configuration--something that didn't exist yet.

---

### Q2

Q2 builds on Q1's foundation, with new capabilities while continuing to iterate on our best features.

---

#### Tool UI Refresh

> Note: This is a major focus in Q2, but may start in Q1 time-permitting.

The UI that displays when an agent calls a tool is outdated and needs a refresh, especially for structured inputs and outputs.

[Artifacts](/docs/features/artifacts) remains a popular feature that will also see improvements, including:

- Rendering outputs from files and tool results
- Dedicated tools for data visualization and analysis
- Making generated artifacts easier to share and maintain between iterations

---

#### Workflows & Interactivity

- **Human-in-the-Loop** ([#5580](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/issues/5580))
  - approval gates for tool usage, letting users review and authorize agent actions before execution
- **Message Queuing & Interruptions**
  - queuing follow-up messages and gracefully interrupting in-progress responses, for a more natural back-and-forth
- **Background Agents and Subagents** ([#11687](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/issues/11687) adjacent)
  - agent workflows that run on a schedule and/or triggered by other agents, enabling automation and background processing

---

#### Infrastructure & Data Management

- File retention policies (automatic cleanup and expiry)
- File storage limits per configuration profile
- AWS CloudFront integration for serving images
- Client-side field-level encryption for sensitive data (primarily message content)

---

### Community-Driven Items

Items with strong community support that may land alongside roadmap work, based on demand and contributions (reactions + PRs):

- MCP Apps ([#10641](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/issues/10641), [PR #11799](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/pull/11799))
- Keyboard shortcuts ([#3664](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/issues/3664))
- Chat folders and projects ([#4848](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/issues/4848))
- A unified file upload experience ([#10941](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/discussions/10941))
- Visible conversation cost and usage metrics ([#1215](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/issues/1215))

These are ranked roughly by GitHub reactions and community discussions. The best way to move an item up is to react on its GitHub issue.

Community contributions are always welcome and appreciated. Pull requests that include quality code, documentation, and prior discussion are more likely to be merged.

### We're Hiring

We're looking for experienced full-stack developers to help maintain LibreChat on contract, with potential to transition into a full-time role. TypeScript proficiency is required; Python is a plus.

**Requirements:**
- Full-stack proficiency (backend + frontend)
- 5+ years of professional experience

### Conclusion

Three years in, LibreChat continues to be the most comprehensive open-source AI chat platform available. The focus this year is depth over breadth--making agents genuinely smarter about context, giving admins the tools they need, and building the interactive workflows that turn chat into something more.

We'll check back at the half-year mark with the H2 roadmap. In the meantime, share your thoughts in the discussion threads below.
