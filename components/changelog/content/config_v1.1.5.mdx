- Added [`streamRate`](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/shared_endpoint_settings#streamrate) to the shared endpoint settings.
    - This setting allows you to control the rate at which data is streamed from the endpoint.
    - You can set a global value for all endpoints or customize it for each individual endpoint.
    - The `all` setting can override all individual endpoint values, making them unnecessary if used.
