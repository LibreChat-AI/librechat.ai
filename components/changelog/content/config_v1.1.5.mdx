- Added [`streamRate`](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/shared_endpoint_settings#streamrate) to the shared endpoint settings.
    - This setting allows you to control the rate at which data is streamed from the endpoint.
    - You can set a global value for all endpoints or customize it for each individual endpoint.
    - The `all` setting can override all individual endpoint values, making them unnecessary if used.

- Added [`speech`](/docs/configuration/stt_tts#speech-introduction) object

- Moved `TTS` and `STT` under the new `speech` object
    - This change allows you to configure speech settings in a more organized way.

- Added [`speechTab`](/docs/configuration/stt_tts#speech-tab-optional) under the new `speech` object
    - This setting allows you to configure the default speech tab settings for LibreChat users
    - Remeber that users can still override them
