  - See [Interface Configuration](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/interface#peoplepicker) for details

- Added `interface.marketplace` configuration for Agent Marketplace access control
  - Added `use` setting to enable/disable marketplace access (default: `false`)
  - Controls visibility and access to the Agent Marketplace feature
  - Access control managed through permission system

  - Available strategies: `"local"`, `"s3"`, `"firebase"`, `"azure_blob"`
  - Backwards compatible with existing `fileStrategy` (single strategy for all files)
  - See [File Strategies Configuration](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/config#filestrategies) for details

- Renamed `webSearch.scraperType` to `webSearch.scraperProvider`
  - Configuration field renamed for consistency with other provider naming conventions
  - See [Web Search Configuration](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/web_search#scraperprovider) for details
- Added `webSearch.firecrawlVersion` to specify Firecrawl API version
  - Allows configuration of Firecrawl API version (v0 or v1)
  - Default: uses environment variable `${FIRECRAWL_VERSION}`
  - See [Web Search Configuration](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/web_search#firecrawlversion) for details

- Added `CONVERSATION_IMPORT_MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES` environment variable
  - Limits the maximum file size for conversation imports in bytes
  - Prevents memory exhaustion from large import files
  - Default: `0` (no limit enforced when not set)
  - Example: `262144000` (250 MiB)
  - See [Environment Variables](/docs/configuration/dotenv#conversation_import_max_file_size_bytes) for details

- Added optional `group` field to modelSpecs configuration
  - Organizes model specs in the UI selector with flexible grouping options
  - Three behaviors based on `group` value:
    - If `group` matches an endpoint name (e.g., "openAI", "groq"), the spec nests under that endpoint
    - If `group` is a custom name (doesn't match any endpoint), creates a separate collapsible section
    - If `group` is omitted, the spec appears as a standalone item at top level
  - See [Model Specs](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/model_specs#group) for details
