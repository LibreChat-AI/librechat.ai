## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **DALL-E Update**: user-provided keys for DALL-E are now specific to each DALL-E version, i.e.: `DALLE3_API_KEY` and `DALLE2_API_KEY`
- Note: `DALLE_API_KEY` will work for both DALL-E-3 and DALL-E-2 when the admin provides the credential; in other words, this may only affect your users if DALLE_API_KEY is not set in the `.env` file. In this case, they will simply have to "uninstall" the plugin, and provide their API key again.
- Unused legacy code will soon be removed from the repo (mainly on the client side)

## 👀 Upcoming Features

- Assistants API integration and General File support continue to be in active development, ETA: end of January
- Prompt-engineering-focused features such as adding/removing messages at any point.
- Better, more customizable, and easier System-wide Configuration for Endpoints/Models/Presets
- [Our full Roadmap](https://github.com/users/danny-avila/projects/2)
