- Added `serverInstructions` to MCP Servers object structure:
  - Controls whether server instructions are included in agent context when using MCP Server tools
  - See: [MCP Servers Object Structure](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/mcp_servers#serverinstructions)

- Added `mcpServers` to the `interface` configuration in `librechat.yaml`:
  - Centralizes UI-related settings for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.
  - This includes the `placeholder` option, which customizes the text shown in the server selection dropdown when no MCP is selected.
  - See: [Interface Object Structure - mcpServers](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/interface#mcp-servers)
- Added user placeholder variables support to Custom Endpoint Headers:
  - Users can now use `{{LIBRECHAT_USER_ID}}`, `{{LIBRECHAT_USER_EMAIL}}`, and other user field placeholders in custom endpoint headers
  - See: [Custom Endpoint Object Structure - Headers](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/custom_endpoint#headers) for details
- Added `temporaryChatRetention` to interface configuration:
  - Configures the retention period for temporary chats in hours (min: 1, max: 8760)
  - Default retention is 720 hours (30 days) if not specified
  - Can be set via environment variable `TEMP_CHAT_RETENTION_HOURS` or in librechat.yaml
  - Applies to newly created temporary chats only; existing chats retain their original expiration
  - See [Interface Object Structure - temporaryChatRetention](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/interface#temporarychatretention) for details
- Added `clientImageResize` to fileConfig configuration:
  - Enables automatic client-side image resizing before upload to prevent failures and optimize performance
  - Configurable maximum dimensions (maxWidth/maxHeight) with aspect ratio preservation
  - Adjustable JPEG/WebP compression quality (0.1-1.0) for file size optimization
  - Supports output format selection between JPEG and WebP
  - Helps reduce bandwidth usage and improve upload speeds
  - See [File Config Object Structure - clientImageResize](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/file_config#clientimageresize) for details
- Enhanced `webSearch` configuration with comprehensive Firecrawl scraper options
  - Added detailed configuration options for Firecrawl scraper including formats, includeTags, excludeTags, headers, waitFor, timeout, maxAge, mobile, skipTlsVerification, parsePDF, removeBase64Images, blockAds, storeInCache, zeroDataRetention, onlyMainContent, location, and changeTrackingOptions
  - See [Web Search Configuration](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/web_search) for details

- Enhanced MCP (Model Context Protocol) server management with connection status tracking and OAuth support
  - Added dynamic status icons showing server state (connected, disconnected, OAuth required, error, initializing)
  - Implemented server (re)initialization with OAuth flow support through dropdown and settings panel
  - Added set/unset state tracking for customUserVars
  - Unified server listing across MCPSelect and MCPPanel with consistent status display
