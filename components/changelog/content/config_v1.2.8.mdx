- Added `temporaryChatRetention` to interface configuration:
  - Configures the retention period for temporary chats in hours (min: 1, max: 8760)
  - Default retention is 720 hours (30 days) if not specified
  - Can be set via environment variable `TEMP_CHAT_RETENTION_HOURS` or in `librechat.yaml`
  - Applies to newly created temporary chats only; existing chats retain their original expiration
  - See [Interface Object Structure - temporaryChatRetention](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/interface#temporarychatretention) for details

- Added `clientImageResize` to `fileConfig` configuration:
  - Enables automatic client-side image resizing before upload to prevent failures and optimize performance
