- Enhanced MCP (Model Context Protocol) server management with comprehensive new features:
  - Added `serverInstructions` to MCP Servers object structure - controls whether server instructions are included in agent context when using MCP Server tools
  - Added user placeholder variables support:
    - `{{LIBRECHAT_USER_ID}}` - replaced with the current user's ID, enabling multi-user support
    - `{{LIBRECHAT_USER_*}}` - dynamic user field placeholders (replace `*` with the UPPERCASE version of any allowed field)
    - Supported in `headers` and `url` fields
  - Added `customUserVars` for per-user credentials:
    - Allows users to securely provide their own API keys and credentials for MCP servers
    - Configurable through UI via settings icon in tool selection or MCP Settings panel
    - Ensures authentication details remain private in multi-user environments
  - Added `mcpServers` to the `interface` configuration:
    - Centralizes UI-related settings for Model Context Protocol servers
    - Includes `placeholder` option to customize text shown in server selection dropdown when no MCP is selected
  - Enhanced server management with connection status tracking and OAuth support:
    - Added dynamic status icons showing server state (connected, disconnected, OAuth required, error, initializing)
    - Implemented server (re)initialization with OAuth flow support through dropdown and settings panel
    - Added set/unset state tracking for `customUserVars`
    - Unified server listing across MCPSelect and MCPPanel with consistent status display
  - See [MCP Servers Object Structure](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/mcp_servers) for complete details

- Added user placeholder variables support to Custom Endpoint Headers:
  - Users can now use the same placeholder variables (`{{LIBRECHAT_USER_ID}}`, `{{LIBRECHAT_USER_EMAIL}}`, etc.) in custom endpoint headers
  - See [Custom Endpoint Object Structure - Headers](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/custom_endpoint#headers) for details

- Added `temporaryChatRetention` to interface configuration:
  - Configures the retention period for temporary chats in hours (min: 1, max: 8760)
  - Default retention is 720 hours (30 days) if not specified
  - Can be set via environment variable `TEMP_CHAT_RETENTION_HOURS` or in `librechat.yaml`
  - Applies to newly created temporary chats only; existing chats retain their original expiration
  - See [Interface Object Structure - temporaryChatRetention](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/interface#temporarychatretention) for details

- Added `clientImageResize` to `fileConfig` configuration:
  - Enables automatic client-side image resizing before upload to prevent failures and optimize performance
  - Configurable maximum dimensions (`maxWidth`/`maxHeight`) with aspect ratio preservation
  - Adjustable JPEG/WebP compression quality (0.1-1.0) for file size optimization
  - Supports output format selection between JPEG and WebP
  - Helps reduce bandwidth usage and improve upload speeds
  - See [File Config Object Structure - clientImageResize](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/file_config#clientimageresize) for details

- Enhanced `webSearch` configuration with comprehensive Firecrawl scraper options:
  - Added detailed configuration options for Firecrawl scraper including `formats`, `includeTags`, `excludeTags`, `headers`, `waitFor`, `timeout`, `maxAge`, `mobile`, `skipTlsVerification`, `parsePDF`, `removeBase64Images`, `blockAds`, `storeInCache`, `zeroDataRetention`, `onlyMainContent`, `location`, and `changeTrackingOptions`
  - See [Web Search Configuration](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/web_search) for details

- Added title generation configuration with advanced options for all endpoints:
  - Added `titleMethod` to control title generation strategy:
    - `"completion"` (new default) - Uses standard completion API for broader LLM compatibility
    - `"structured"` or `"functions"` (legacy) - Uses structured output/function calling (not all providers support this)
  - Added `titlePrompt` for customizing the main title generation prompt:
    - Must include `{convo}` placeholder for conversation content
    - Allows full control over how the AI generates titles
  - Added `titlePromptTemplate` for customizing conversation formatting:
    - Must include `{input}` and `{output}` placeholders
    - Default: `"User: {input}\nAI: {output}"`
    - Controls how the conversation is formatted when inserted into `titlePrompt`
  - Added `titleEndpoint` to use alternative endpoints for title generation:
    - Supported values: `openAI`, `azureOpenAI`, `google`, `anthropic`, `bedrock`
    - For custom endpoints, use the exact custom endpoint name as defined in configuration
    - Allows using a different, potentially cheaper model/endpoint for titles
  - All title configuration options are now available as [Shared Endpoint Settings](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/shared_endpoint_settings) 
  - Can be configured globally using the `all:` endpoint definition
  - See individual endpoint documentation for specific examples

- Improved [Model Specs documentation](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/model_specs) with parameter support updates:
