- Added `allowedProviders` to [Agents](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/agents)
  - Allows administrators to specify a list of endpoint providers (e.g., `openAI`, `anthropic`, `google`) that are permitted for use with the Agents feature.
  - If defined, only agents configured with these providers can be initialized.
  - This provides better control over which providers can be used with the Agents feature, enhancing security and compliance.

- Implemented `addedEndpoints` in [Model Specs](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/model_specs)
  - **`modelSpecs.addedEndpoints`**: Enables specific endpoints (e.g., `openAI`, `google`) to be selectable in the UI even when `modelSpecs` are defined and prioritized. This allows users to choose standard models alongside specialized specs. Requires `interface.modelSelect` to be `true`. See [Model Specs Docs](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/model_specs#addedendpoints) for more details.
  - If `modelSpecs.addedEndpoints` is provided, `interface.modelSelect` will default to `true` if not explicitly set, ensuring the model selection dropdown is visible.

- Added `timeout` to [MCP Servers](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/mcp_servers)
  - Controls how long to wait for a response from MCP server tool requests (in milliseconds)
  - Provides better control over MCP server request behavior
  - Allows adjusting timeouts based on expected response times for different MCP servers

---

- Added `initTimeout` to [MCP Servers](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/mcp_servers)
  - Controls how long to wait for MCP server initialization (in milliseconds)
  - Allows configuration of initialization timeouts for servers that may take longer to start up
  - Helps fine-tune performance for specific environments and use cases

---

- Implemented [Balance Configuration](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/balance)
  - Set `enabled` to `true` to check user balances; replaces `CHECK_BALANCE` environment variable
  - Set `startBalance` to desired starting balance; replaces `START_BALANCE` environment variable
  - Added `autoRefillEnabled` to enable automatic token credit refills for users
  - Added `refillIntervalValue` to specify the numerical value for refill intervals
  - Added `refillIntervalUnit` to specify the time unit for refill intervals (seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months)
  - Added `refillAmount` to specify the number of tokens added during each refill
  - Improved balance synchronization to ensure user settings match global configuration
  - Provides administrators with more control over token usage and user balance management
  - For more details, see the [Token Usage Guide](/docs/configuration/token_usage)

---

- Deprecated `interface.endpointsMenu` in [Interface](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/interface#endpointsmenu)
  - This setting will be removed in a future version
  - Use `interface.modelSelect` instead for controlling endpoint/model selection visibility
  - If you would like to limit the available endpoints while using model specs, configure the [`modelSpecs.addedEndpoints`](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/model_specs#addedendpoints) setting.
