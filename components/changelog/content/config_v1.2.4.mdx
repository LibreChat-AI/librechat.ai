- Added `allowedProviders` to [Agents](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/agents)
  - Allows administrators to specify a list of endpoint providers (e.g., `openAI`, `anthropic`, `google`) that are permitted for use with the Agents feature.
  - If defined, only agents configured with these providers can be initialized.
  - This provides better control over which providers can be used with the Agents feature, enhancing security and compliance.

- Implemented `addedEndpoints` in [Model Specs](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/model_specs)
  -   **`modelSpecs.addedEndpoints`**: Enables specific endpoints (e.g., `openAI`, `google`) to be selectable in the UI even when `modelSpecs` are defined and prioritized. This allows users to choose standard models alongside specialized specs. Requires `interface.modelSelect` to be `true`. See [Model Specs Docs](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/model_specs#addedendpoints) for more details.
  -   If `modelSpecs.addedEndpoints` is provided, `interface.modelSelect` will default to `true` if not explicitly set, ensuring the model selection dropdown is visible.

- Added `timeout` to [MCP Servers](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/mcp_servers)
  - Controls how long to wait for a response from MCP server tool requests (in milliseconds)
  - Provides better control over MCP server request behavior
  - Allows adjusting timeouts based on expected response times for different MCP servers

- Added `initTimeout` to [MCP Servers](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/mcp_servers)
  - Controls how long to wait for MCP server initialization (in milliseconds)
  - Allows configuration of initialization timeouts for servers that may take longer to start up
  - Helps fine-tune performance for specific environments and use cases
