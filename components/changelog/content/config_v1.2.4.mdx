- Added `timeout` to [MCP Servers](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/mcp_servers)
  - Controls how long to wait for a response from MCP server tool requests (in milliseconds)
  - Provides better control over MCP server request behavior
  - Allows adjusting timeouts based on expected response times for different MCP servers

- Added `initTimeout` to [MCP Servers](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/mcp_servers)
  - Controls how long to wait for MCP server initialization (in milliseconds)
  - Allows configuration of initialization timeouts for servers that may take longer to start up
  - Helps fine-tune performance for specific environments and use cases
