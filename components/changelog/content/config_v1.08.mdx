- Added additional fields to [interface config](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/interface) to toggle access to specific features:
  - `endpointsMenu`, `modelSelect`, `parameters`, `sidePanel`, `presets`
- Now ensures the following fields always have defaults set:
  - `cache`, `imageOutputType`, `fileStrategy`, `registration`
- Added [`modelSpecs`](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/model_specs) for a configurable UI experience, simplifying model selection with specific presets and tools.
- Added [`filteredTools`](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/config#filteredtools) to disable specific plugins/tools without any changes to the codebase
  - Affects both `gptPlugins` and `assistants` endpoints
- [`iconURL`](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/custom_endpoint#iconurl) can now be to set to one of the main endpoints to use existing project icons
  - "openAI" | "azureOpenAI" | "google" | "anthropic" | "assistants" | "gptPlugins"
- Invalid YAML format is now logged for easier debugging
