- Added `maxRecursionLimit` to [Agents Endpoint](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/agents#maxrecursionlimit)
  - Sets the absolute maximum number of steps an agent can take in a run
  - Defines the upper limit for `recursionLimit` that can be set from the UI
  - If omitted, defaults to the value of `recursionLimit` or 25 if `recursionLimit` is also omitted
  - For more information about agent steps, see [Max Agent Steps](/docs/features/agents#max-agent-steps)
- Updated `recursionLimit` in [Agents Endpoint](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/agents#recursionlimit)
  - Now represents the default number of steps an agent can take in a run
  - This value can be configured from the UI up to the `maxRecursionLimit` (if one is provided)
  - For more information about agent steps, see [Max Agent Steps](/docs/features/agents#max-agent-steps)
- Added `artifacts` to [Agent Capabilities](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/agents#capabilities)
  - Enables agents to generate and display interactive content, such as React components, HTML code, and Mermaid diagrams
  - For more information, see [Artifacts](/docs/features/artifacts)
- Added `chain` to [Agent Capabilities](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/agents#capabilities)
  - Enables a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) approach for complex tasks
  - Allows creation of chains of specialized agents that work together
  - Each agent in the chain can access outputs from previous agents
  - For more information, see [Agent Chain](/docs/features/agents#agent-chain)
