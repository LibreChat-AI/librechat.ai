- Added `context` capability for agents endpoint
  - Enables both "Upload as Text" functionality in chat and "File Context" for agents
  - Allows users to upload files and have their content extracted and included directly in the conversation or agent instructions
  - Works with text parsing by default; no external services required
  - Enhanced by the `ocr` capability when OCR service is configured
  - Default enabled in the capabilities list
  - See [Agents Configuration](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/agents#capabilities) for details

- Added OCR, text parsing, and STT separation to `fileConfig`:
  - Added `ocr` configuration to control which file types use OCR processing
  - Added `text` configuration to control which file types use direct text extraction
  - Added `stt` configuration to control which audio file types use Speech-to-Text transcription
  - Added `fileTokenLimit` parameter to control maximum token limits for file text extraction
  - Separate processing paths for visual documents (OCR), text files (native parsing), and audio files (STT)
  - Processing precedence: OCR > STT > text parsing > fallback
  - Default OCR support: images (JPEG, GIF, PNG, WebP, HEIC, HEIF), PDFs, Office documents, EPUB files
  - Default text parsing support: all text MIME types and common programming languages
  - Default STT support: audio formats (MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, M4A, WebM, etc.)
  - Text from attached files is truncated to `fileTokenLimit` at runtime just before prompt construction (default: 100000)
  - See [File Config Object Structure](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/file_config) for details

- Added `transactions` object structure
  - Controls whether token usage records are saved to the database
  - Can be configured independently from the balance system
  - Automatically enabled when `balance.enabled` is set to `true`
  - Default value is `true` to ensure token usage is tracked by default
  - Disabling transactions reduces database storage but prevents historical usage analysis
  - See [Transactions Configuration](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/transactions) for details

- Added `jinaApiUrl` to `webSearch` configuration
  - Environment variable name for the Jina API URL
  - Optional field only needed if using a custom Jina instance
  - If not set in .env, users will be prompted to provide it via UI
  - See [Web Search Configuration](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/web_search#jinaapiurl) for details
