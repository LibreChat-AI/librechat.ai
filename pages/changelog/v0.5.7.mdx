    - In general, the UI is cleaner, matches the basic style of the official site more closely
    - Special attention was given to dialogs/modals across all screen sizes and are now drastically optimized from before.
    - Developer experience was also greatly improved, not least of all with type safety, but Endpoint settings are now extremely modular from what they were before, making existing code much more manageable, and future endpoint integrations much easier
