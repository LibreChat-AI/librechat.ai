- **Meilisearch Update**: Following the recent update to Meilisearch, an unused folder named `meili_data` may be present in your root directory. This folder is no longer required and can be **safely deleted** to free up space.
- **New Indexing Data Location**: The indexing data has been relocated. It will now be stored in a new folder named `meili_data_v1.x`, where `1.x` represents the version of Meilisearch. For instance, with the current Meilisearch version `1.5`, the folder will be `meili_data_v1.5`.
