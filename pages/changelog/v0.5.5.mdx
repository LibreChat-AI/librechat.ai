# What's Changed

This update introduces ChatGPT Plugins (OpenAPI specs) for use with our Plugins endpoint! One of the main use cases we gain from integrating them to LibreChat is to allow use of official plugins with gpt-3.5 models, and without ChatGPT Plus. Read the [full documentation](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/blob/main/docs/features/plugins/chatgpt_plugins_openapi.md) to learn how to add/configure them, although I've included some.

> Note: LibreChat's implementation is not 1:1 with ChatGPT's, depends on the [LangChainJS library](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchainjs), and is a working first pass. For more disclaimers on the limitations, [read here](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/blob/main/docs/features/plugins/chatgpt_plugins_openapi.md#disclaimers)
