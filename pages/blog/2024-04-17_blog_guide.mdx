# Welcome, Aspiring Blog Contributors! üôå

Are you eager to share your expertise and insights with our vibrant community? Contributing to our blog is a fantastic way to do just that! In this beginner-friendly guide, we'll walk you through the process of creating your first blog post and making your mark on our platform. Let's dive in! üåü

## Before you Begin

Before you begin, you'll need to fork and clone the website's repo located at: https://github.com/LibreChat-AI/librechat.ai

<Callout type="note" title="Detailed instructions" collapsible>

Please carefully follow the instructions below to ensure a smooth start:

1. **Fork the Repository**: 
    - Navigate to the [LibreChat-AI GitHub repository](https://github.com/LibreChat-AI/librechat.ai).
    - Click on the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the page to create your own copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Once you have forked the repository, clone it to your local machine. Open your terminal and run the following command, replacing `<your-username>` with your GitHub username:
      ```sh
      git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/librechat.ai.git
      ```
    - This will create a local copy of the repository on your computer. Navigate into the project directory:
      ```sh
      cd librechat.ai
      ```

3. **Set Upstream Remote**:
    - To keep your fork up-to-date with the original repository, you'll need to set the original repository as the upstream remote. Run the following commands:
      ```sh
      git remote add upstream https://github.com/LibreChat-AI/librechat.ai.git
      git fetch upstream
      ```

4. **Create a New Branch**:
    - It's best practice to create a new branch for your blog post to keep your work organized and separate from the main branch. You can create and switch to a new branch with the following commands:
      ```sh
      git checkout -b your-branch-name
      ```
    - Replace `your-branch-name` with a descriptive name for your branch, such as `add-new-post`.

5. **Install Dependencies**:
    - Install dependencies by running:
      ```sh
      pnpm install
      ```
    - Ensure that you have Node.js and `pnpm` (a fast, disk space efficient package manager) installed on your machine. You can install `pnpm` globally using npm if you haven't already:
      ```sh
      npm install -g pnpm
      ```

## Step 1: Set Up Your Author Profile üë§

Before you start crafting your blog post, you'll need to create an author profile. This helps our readers get to know the brilliant mind behind the content. Here's how:

1. Create a new file in the `pages/authors` directory, following the format `authorid.mdx`.
2. Add your profile picture to the `public/images/people` folder.
3. Fill in the template with your details, including your name, bio, and social media links.

<Callout title="Prefer to Stay Anonymous?">
  No worries! If you'd rather not create a personal profile, you can use the "anon" profile by adding `authorid: anon` to your blog post metadata.
</Callout>

```mdx filename="authorid.mdx"
---
title: Your Name Profile
authorid: your-authorid
subtitle: Job Title or Short Description
name: Your Name
bio: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla litora ridiculus magna et etiam mi. Dolor etiam id elit morbi ipsum mauris. Non dapibus urna platea elementum fusce vulputate.

import AuthorProfile from '@/components/Author/AuthorProfile'

<AuthorProfile authorId="your-authorid" />
```

## Step 2: Craft Your Blog Post ‚úçÔ∏è

Now, it's time to let your creativity flow! We use MDX for our blog posts, which allows you to seamlessly blend markdown and JSX. This means you can create interactive and engaging content by importing components like charts and alerts.

To create your blog post:

1. Place your post in the `pages/blog` directory, using the naming scheme `yyyy-mm-dd_short_title.mdx`.
2. Add a thumbnail image to the `public/images/blog` folder, using the same name as your blog post file.
3. Include the necessary metadata and header in your document, as shown in the example.
4. Let your thoughts and ideas pour onto the page! üéâ

```mdx filename="metadata and header"

## Step 3: Test and Submit Your Post üöÄ

Before submitting your blog post, it's crucial to ensure everything looks perfect. Take a moment to review your author profile, the blog landing page, and your post itself.

To test your changes:

1. Prepare the environment by running `pnpm install`.
2. Start the development server with `pnpm dev`.
3. Build the project using `pnpm build` and `pnpm start`.

<Callout type="note" title="Testing">
  Ensure that all links, images, and embedded components in your blog post are working correctly before submitting.
