# Our New Translation Tool

We’re thrilled to announce the launch of our brand new translation tool for LibreChat—a major step forward in our mission to make LibreChat accessible to users around the world. Powered by [Locize](https://locize.com), this integration not only streamlines the translation process but also enhances the way we collaborate as a community.

For years, community contributions have been the backbone of LibreChat’s success. With our new tool, every translation string is now centrally managed, ensuring consistency and making updates faster than ever before. Whether you’re translating a few key phrases or contributing a full language pack, our new system makes it simpler and more intuitive to see where your efforts are needed most.

One of the standout features of this integration is the real-time translation progress dashboard. Dynamic badges now provide a live snapshot of translation progress for each language. This transparency means that you can quickly identify which languages are thriving and where more contributions are needed—empowering you to make a significant impact on the project.

Our commitment to a community-driven approach remains as strong as ever. We believe that every contribution, no matter how small, helps build a more inclusive experience for LibreChat users worldwide. With the new Locize-powered tool, you’re not just translating text; you’re helping shape the future of communication for a global audience.

This upgrade is more than just a tool update—it’s a celebration of our community’s ongoing efforts and a promise of even greater collaboration ahead. We’re excited to see how this improved workflow will bring more voices to the LibreChat platform, and we invite you to join us in this journey.

Thank you for your continued support and contributions. Let’s work together to make LibreChat a truly multilingual platform that serves everyone, everywhere.
