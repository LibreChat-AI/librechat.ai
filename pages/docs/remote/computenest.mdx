ComputeNest provides a one-click install option for deploying LibreChat, making the process even simpler. Here's how you can do it:

## Steps

### **Visit the LibreChat repository**

Go to the [LibreChat repository](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat) on GitHub.

### **Create a AliYun account**

[Sign up for a Railway account](https://railway.app?referralCode=HI9hWz) if you don't already have one (this link includes a referral code that supports the LibreChat project).

### **Click the "Deploy on AliBaba Cloud ComputeNest" button**

(The button is also available in the repository's README file)

### **Deploy**

Fill in the information as prompted on the page, click "Next: Confirm Order," and preview the configuration information and prices.

Once you confirm that everything is correct, click "Create Now."

### **Access your LibreChat instance**

After the deployment is successful, ComputeNest will provide you with a public URL where you can access your LibreChat instance.

That's it! You have successfully deployed LibreChat on ComputeNest using the one-click install process. You can now start using and customizing your LibreChat instance as needed.
