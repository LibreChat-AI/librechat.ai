# Deploying LibreChat on Railway (One-Click Install)

Railway provides a one-click install option for deploying LibreChat, making the process even simpler. Here's how you can do it:

## Steps

### **Visit the LibreChat repository**

Go to the [LibreChat repository](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat) on GitHub.

### **Create a Railway account**

[Sign up for a Railway account](https://railway.app?referralCode=HI9hWz) if you don't already have one (this link includes a referral code that supports the LibreChat project).

### **Click the "Deploy on Railway" button**

    </a>
</p>

(The button is also available in the repository's README file)


### **Configure environment variables**

Railway will automatically detect the required environment variables for LibreChat. Review the configuration of the three containers and click `Save Config` after reviewing each of them.

The default configuration will get you started, but for more advanced features, you can consult our documentation on the subject: [Environment Variables](/docs/configuration/dotenv)

### **Deploy**

Once you've filled in the required environment variables, click the "Deploy" button. Railway will handle the rest, including setting up a PostgreSQL database and building/deploying your LibreChat instance.

### **Access your LibreChat instance**

After the deployment is successful, Railway will provide you with a public URL where you can access your LibreChat instance.

That's it! You have successfully deployed LibreChat on Railway using the one-click install process. You can now start using and customizing your LibreChat instance as needed.

## Additional Tips

- Regularly check the LibreChat repository for updates and redeploy your instance to receive the latest features and bug fixes.
- You can find the "redeploy" option in Railway after you login by clicking the 3 dots to the right of "view logs" button

For more detailed instructions and troubleshooting, refer to the official LibreChat documentation and the Railway guides.
