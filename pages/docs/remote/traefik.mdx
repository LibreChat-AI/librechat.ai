# Using Traefik with LibreChat on Docker

[Traefik](https://traefik.io/) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes it easy to deploy and manage your services. If you're running LibreChat on Docker, you can use Traefik to expose your instance securely over HTTPS with automatic SSL certificate management.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- A domain name pointing to your server's IP address

## Configuration

### Configure Traefik and LibreChat

    In your docker-compose.override.yml file, add the following configuration:

```yaml filename="docker-compose.override.yml"
version: '3'

services:
    api:
      labels:
        - "traefik.enable=true"
        - "traefik.http.routers.librechat.rule=Host(`your.domain.name`)"
        - "traefik.http.routers.librechat.entrypoints=websecure"
        - "traefik.http.routers.librechat.tls.certresolver=leresolver"
        - "traefik.http.services.librechat.loadbalancer.server.port=3080"
      networks:
        - librechat_default
      volumes:
        - ./librechat.yaml:/app/librechat.yaml
  
    traefik:
      image: traefik:v3.0
      ports:
        - "80:80"
        - "443:443"
      volumes:
        - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro"
        - "./letsencrypt:/letsencrypt"
      networks:
        - librechat_default
      command:
        - "--log.level=DEBUG"
        - "--api.insecure=true"
        - "--providers.docker=true"
        - "--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false"
        - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
        - "--entrypoints.websecure.address=:443"
        - "--certificatesresolvers.leresolver.acme.tlschallenge=true"
        - "--certificatesresolvers.leresolver.acme.email=your@email.com"
        - "--certificatesresolvers.leresolver.acme.storage=/letsencrypt/acme.json"

# other configs here #

# NOTE: This needs to be at the bottom of your docker-compose.override.yml
networks:
  librechat_default:
    external: true
```

  Replace `your@email.com` with your email address for Let's Encrypt certificate notifications.

  see: [Docker Override](/docs/configuration/docker_override) for more info.

### Start the containers

  ```bash filename="Start the containers"
  docker-compose up -d
  ```

  This will start Traefik and LibreChat containers. Traefik will automatically obtain an SSL/TLS certificate from Let's Encrypt and expose your LibreChat instance securely over HTTPS.

You can now access your LibreChat instance at `https://your.domain.name`. Traefik will handle SSL/TLS termination and reverse proxy requests to your LibreChat container.

## Additional Notes

- The Traefik configuration listens on ports 80 and 443 for HTTP and HTTPS traffic, respectively. Ensure that these ports are open on your server's firewall.
- Traefik stores SSL/TLS certificates in the `./letsencrypt` directory on your host machine. You may want to back up this directory periodically.
- For more advanced configuration options, refer to the official Traefik documentation: [https://doc.traefik.io/](https://doc.traefik.io/)

## Static File Caching and Compression

LibreChat now supports static file caching and compression natively. If you're using Traefik to handle compression, you should disable compression in LibreChat to avoid redundant processing. You can do this by setting the `DISABLE_COMPRESSION` environment variable to `true` in your LibreChat configuration.

```.env
# .env file
DISABLE_COMPRESSION=true
```

This will prevent LibreChat from compressing static files, allowing Traefik to handle compression more efficiently.

For more information on static file handling in LibreChat, including caching options, refer to the [Static File Handling](/docs/configuration/dotenv#static-file-handling) documentation.
