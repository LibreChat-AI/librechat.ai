# Deployment a LibreChat Helm Chart

The following instructions guide you to deploy LibreChat on Kubernetes using Helm.

Note: this method was contributed by the community. If you are familiar with Helm and Kubernetes, use this guide as a reference and adjust to your needs. You can also reference other helm charts made by the community below in the [Community Helm Charts](#community-helm-charts) section.

## Prerequisites

* A running Kubernetes cluster
* `kubectl` installed
* Helm installed on your local machine

## Configuration

1. Use the [Credentials Generator](/toolkit/creds_generator) to quickly generate secure values for `CREDS_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` and `MEILI_MASTER_KEY`.
Place them in a Kubernetes Secret like this (If you want to change the secret name, remember to change it in your helm values):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: librechat-credentials-env
  namespace: <librechat-chart-namespace>
type: Opaque
stringData:
  CREDS_KEY: <generated value>
  JWT_SECRET: <generated value>
  JWT_REFRESH_SECRET: <generated value>
  MEILI_MASTER_KEY: <generated value>
```
2. Add Credentials to the Secret Dependant of the Model you want to use, create Credentials in your provider and add them to the Secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
. . . .

  OPENAI_API_KEY: <your secret value>
```
3. Apply the Secret to the Cluster


## Install Helm Chart
In the root directory run: 

`helm install <deployment-name> helmchart`

Similar to other Helm charts, there exists a [values file](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/blob/main/helm/librechat/values.yaml) that serves two primary functions: it outlines the default settings and indicates which configurations are adjustable.

create a values.yaml file with the values you want to change in comparison to the base values


After that you can run the following command: `helm install librechat helmchart --values <values-override-filel>`
     

## Uninstall Helm Chart

In order to uninstall the Helm Chart simply run: `helm uninstall <deployment-name>`

Example: `helm uninstall librechat`

## Migrate 1.x -> 2.x
If you used the chart before version 2.x you may have to change your value structure.

1. Move Config to librechat.configEnv
```diff
- env:
-     ALLOW_EMAIL_LOGIN: "true"
-     ALLOW_REGISTRATION: "true"
+ librechat:
+   configEnv:
+     ALLOW_REGISTRATION: "true"
+     ALLOW_EMAIL_LOGIN: "true"
```

2. Move all your secret Values to a single Secret as described [Configuration Step 1](#configuration). 
3. If you still want to use an external MongoDB instance, refer to the [values file](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/blob/main/helm/librechat/values.yaml) of the Chart, deactivate the components accordingly and change the fqdn of the Mongodb Instance. This is recommended if you already have data in your externally managed mongodb instance.
