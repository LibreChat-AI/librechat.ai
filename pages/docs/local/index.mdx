# Install LibreChat Locally

**We recommend using `Docker Compose{:hack}` to install LibreChat**, as it is the easiest, simplest, and most reliable method for getting started. With Docker, you can quickly spin up a container that includes everything you need to run LibreChat, including MongoDB, MeiliSearch, as well as the rag_api & vectordb for file support across all endpoints. This approach ensures consistency across different environments and eliminates the need for manual setup of dependencies, making it ideal for most use cases.

Alternatively, you can install LibreChat using the `npm{:zig}` install method. However, this method requires manual setup of MongoDB, MeiliSearch, and the "rag_api + vectordb" dependencies, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.

Whether you choose the Docker, npm install method, or Helm chart for Kubernetes, we have detailed instructions to help you get started with LibreChat.
