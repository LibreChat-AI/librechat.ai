# Temporary Chat

Keep your chat history clean and focused by using temporary chats for sensitive topics, quick experiments, or anything you don't need to permanently save. These chats are excluded from search results, cannot be bookmarked, and are automatically deleted after 30 days.

## Activating Temporary Chat

1.  Open the model list dropdown menu located on the top left side of LibreChat.
2.  Toggle the "Temporary Chat" slider to the ON position.
3.  A notification will appear above the chat input area, confirming that Temporary Chat mode is active.

## What Happens When a Chat is Marked as Temporary?

*   Temporary Chats do not appear in the chat history sidebar.
*   Temporary Chats are excluded from search results.
*   Temporary Chats cannot be bookmarked.
*   Temporary Chats are stored in the database for 30 days and then automatically deleted.

*Note:* Temporary Chats are *not* automatically deleted when you close the conversation window. They will remain in the database for 30 days unless you manually delete the chat before then.
