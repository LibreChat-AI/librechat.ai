# Temporary Chat

Keep your chat history clean and focused by using temporary chats for sensitive topics, quick experiments, or anything you don't need to permanently save. These chats are excluded from search results, cannot be bookmarked, and are automatically deleted after 30 days.

## Activating Temporary Chat

1.  Open the model list dropdown menu located on the top left side of LibreChat.
2.  Toggle the "Temporary Chat" slider to the ON position.
