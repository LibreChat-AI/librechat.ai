# User Authentication System

LibreChat has a user authentication system that allows users to sign up and log in securely and easily. The system is scalable and can handle a large number of concurrent users without compromising performance or security.

By default, we have email signup and login enabled, which means users can create an account using their email address and a password. They can also reset their password if they forget it.

Additionally, our system can integrate social logins from various platforms such as Google, GitHub, Discord, OpenID, and more. This means users can log in using their existing accounts on these platforms, without having to create a new account or remember another password.

**For further details, refer to the configuration guides provided here: [Authentication](/docs/configuration/authentication)**

<Callout type="warning" title="Important">
- When you run the app for the first time, you need to create a new account by clicking on "Sign up" on the login page. The first account you make will be the admin account. The admin account doesn't have any special features right now, but it might be useful for the admin dashboard to manage other users later.
- The first account created should ideally be a local account (email and password).
