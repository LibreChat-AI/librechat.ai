Conversation branches are preserved in shared links, allowing recipients to explore different conversation paths and see how the discussion evolved.

  <div style={{flex: "1", minWidth: "300px"}}>

## Frequently Asked Questions

A: No, shared links are read-only. Recipients can view the conversation but cannot add messages or interact with the AI.

**Q: What happens if I delete a conversation after sharing it?**
A: The shared link will no longer be accessible, and any user which navigates to that link will be served a page stating "Shared link not found".

**Q: Can I edit a conversation after sharing it?**
A: The shared link captures the conversation at the time of creation. Additional messages will not be reflected in the shared view - however, edits made to the existing messages will be shown.
