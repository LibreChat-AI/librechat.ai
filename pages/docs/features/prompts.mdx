# Prompts

LibreChat's Prompts feature allows you to save, organize, and quickly reuse frequently used prompts across your conversations.
This powerful tool helps streamline your workflow by providing easy access to your most important prompts through slash commands in chat or through the Prompts panel in the side navigation bar.

## Overview

The Prompts feature enables you to:

- Save frequently used prompts for quick access
- Organize prompts into categories

## Creating and Managing Prompts

### Creating a New Prompt

You can create a new prompt by clicking the "New Prompt" button found in the Prompts panel within the right hand side navigation menu.

This will open the Prompt Creation dialog, where you can configure your prompt's name, content, category, variables, description, command-name, and attachments, as well as browse previously created prompts.

- Files are made available to the AI in chat when the prompt is used
- Supports the same file types as regular chat attachments
- Files are stored with the prompt for future use / configuration

### Variables

Use double braces in your text to create variables, e.g. `{{example variable}}`, to later fill when using the prompt.

**Special variables:**
You can select special variables from the dropdown: `{{current_date}}` (today's date and day of week), `{{current_datetime}}` (local date and time), `{{utc_iso_datetime}}` (UTC ISO datetime), and `{{current_user}}` (your account name).

**Dropdown variables:**
Create custom dropdown menus for your prompts: `{{variable_name:option1|option2|option3}}`


### Advanced Configuration

The Prompts Creation dialog has 2 modes: *Simple* and *Advanced*  that you can switch between using the toggle at the top right of the dialog. 

![Advanced configuration](/images/prompts/advanced.png)

In advanced mode, you can switch between, delete, edit, create, and set specific versions as the default to be used in chat by marking them as 'production' using the Rocket Icon button.
There will also be a new toggle at the top of the dialog which allows you to choose whether new versions will automatically be set as production.

## Accessing Prompts

### Side Navigation Panel

The Prompts panel in the side navigation provides comprehensive access to your saved prompts:

From the side navigation, you can:
- Browse all your saved prompts
- Filter prompts by category, name, and whether they have been shared to others
- Preview prompt content before using them in chat

### Chat Commands

You can quickly access prompts directly in chat using their names as commands:

Type `/` followed by your prompt name (e.g., `/test` or `/travelprompt`) to quickly insert it into your message.


## Using Prompts

### Auto-Send Feature

Enable auto-send for prompts you want to execute immediately:
