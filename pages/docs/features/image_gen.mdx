## 🎨 Image Generation & Editing

LibreChat comes with **built-in image tools** that you can add to an **[Agent](/docs/features/agents).**

Each has its own look, price-point, and setup step (usually just an API key or URL).

| Tool                   | Best for                                                                           | Needs                                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **OpenAI Image Tools** | Cutting-edge results (GPT-Image-1).<br/>Can also **_edit_** the images you upload. | OpenAI API                           |
| **DALL·E (3 / 2)**     | Legacy OpenAI Image models.                                                        | OpenAI API                           |
| **Stable Diffusion**   | Local or self-hosted generation, endless community models.                         | Automatic1111 API                    |
| **Flux**               | Fast cloud renders, optional fine-tunes.                                           | Flux API                             |
| **MCP**                | Bring-your-own-Image-Generators                                                    | MCP server with image output support |

**Notes:**

- API keys can be omitted in favor of allowing the user to enter their own key from the UI.
- Image Outputs are directly sent to the LLM as part of the immediate chat context following generation.
  - The LLM will only get vision context from images attached to user messages, and not from generations/edits, except for immediately after generation.
  - See [Image Storage and Handling](#image-storage-and-handling) for more details.
- MCP Server tool image outputs are supported, which may output images similarly to LC's built-in tools.
  - Note: MCP servers may or may not use the correct format when outputting images. See details in the [MCP section below](#5--model-context-protocol-mcp).

## 1 · OpenAI Image Tools (recommended)

### Features

"OpenAI Image Tools" are an agent toolkit made up of 2 separate tools.

- **Image Generation**:
  - **Create** brand-new images from text prompts (no upload required).
- **Image Editing**:
  - **Edit** or **remix** the images you just uploaded—change colours, add objects, extend the canvas, etc.
- Both use OpenAI's latest image generation model, **GPT-Image-1**, for superior instruction following, text rendering, detailed editing, real-world knowledge
- See OpenAI's [Image Generation documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/image-generation?image-generation-model=gpt-image-1) for more details.

#### Generation vs. Editing

| Use-case                | Invokes              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| "Start from scratch"    | **Image Generation** |
| "Use existing image(s)" | **Image Editing**    |

The agent decides which tool to use based on the context:

- **Image Generation** creates brand new images from text descriptions only
- **Image Editing** modifies or remixes existing images using their image IDs
  - These can be images from the current message or previously generated/referenced images
  - The LLM keeps track of image IDs as long as they remain in the context window
  - Includes the referenced image IDs in the tool output
- Both tools are always available, but the LLM will choose the appropriate one based on the user's request
- Both tools will include the generated image ID in the tool output

⚠️ **Important**

- Image editing relies on image IDs, which are retained in the chat history.
- When files are uploaded to the current request, their image IDs are added to the context of the LLM before any tokens are generated.
- Previously referenced or generated image IDs can be used for editing, as long as they remain within the context window.
- The LLM can include any relevant image IDs in the `image_ids` array when calling the image editing tool.
- You can also attach previously uploaded images from the side panel without needing to upload them again.
  - This also has the added benefit of providing a vision model with the image context, which can be useful for informing the `prompt` for the image editing tool.

### Parameters

#### Image Generation

• **prompt** – text description (required)  
• **size** – `auto` (default), `1024x1024` (square), `1536x1024` (landscape), or `1024x1536` (portrait)  
• **quality** – `auto` (default), `high`, `medium`, or `low`  
• **background** – `auto` (default), `transparent`, or `opaque` (transparent requires PNG or WebP format)

#### Image Editing

## 3 · Stable Diffusion (local)

Run images entirely on your own machine or server.  
Point LibreChat at any Automatic1111 (or compatible) endpoint and you're set.

### Parameters

• **prompt** – Detailed keywords describing desired elements in the image (required)  
• **negative_prompt** – Keywords describing elements to exclude from the image (required)

The Stable Diffusion implementation uses these default parameters:

- cfg_scale: 4.5
- steps: 22
- width: 1024
- height: 1024

These values are currently fixed but provide good results for most use cases.

### Setup

```bash
SD_WEBUI_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7860  # URL to your Automatic1111 WebUI
```

No API key required—just the reachable URL.

More details on setting up Automatic1111 can be found in the dedicated [Stable Diffusion guide](/docs/configuration/tools/stable_diffusion).

## 4 · Flux

Cloud generator with an emphasis on speed and optional fine-tuned models.

### Features

- Fast cloud-based image generation
- Support for fine-tuned models
- Multiple quality levels and aspect ratios
- Raw mode for less processed, more natural-looking images

### Parameters

The Flux tool supports three main actions:

1. **generate** - Create a new image from a text prompt
2. **generate_finetuned** - Create an image using a fine-tuned model
3. **list_finetunes** - List available custom models for the user

More details can be found in the dedicated [Flux guide](/docs/configuration/tools/flux#parameters).

### Setup

```bash
FLUX_API_KEY=flux_live_...
FLUX_API_BASE_URL=https://api.us1.bfl.ai   # default is fine for most users
```

Choose the **Flux** tool inside the Agent. Prompts are plain text; one call produces one image.

### Pricing

See the [Flux pricing page](https://docs.bfl.ml/pricing/) for details on costs associated with image generation.

## 5 · Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Image outputs are supported from MCP servers.

For example, the [Puppeteer MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/puppeteer) can be used to generate screenshots of web pages, which correctly output the image in the expected format and is treated the same as LC's built-in image tools.

> The examples below assume LibreChat is running outside of Docker, directly using Node.js. The Model Context Protocol is a relatively new framework, and many developers are still learning how to properly serve their systems with uv/node for scalable distribution.

> As this technology is still emerging, there are currently few image-generating servers available, and many existing ones have yet to adopt the correct response format for images.

> While many MCP servers do function well within Docker, the following examples do not, or not without more advanced configurations, showcasing some of the current inconsistency between MCP servers.

```yaml
mcpServers:
  puppeteer:
    command: npx
    args:
      - -y
      - '@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer'
```

The following is an example of an [Image Generation server](https://github.com/GongRzhe/Image-Generation-MCP-Server) that outputs images using [Replicate API](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens), but returns URLs of the images, which doesn't conform to MCP's image response standard.

> Note: for this particular server, you need to install the `@gongrzhe/image-gen-server` package globally using npm, i.e. `npm install -g @gongrzhe/image-gen-server`, then point to the package's compiled files as shown below.

```yaml
mcpServers:
  image-gen:
    command: 'node'
    # First, install the package globally using npm:
    # `npm install -g @gongrzhe/image-gen-server`
    # Then, point to the location of the installed package,
    # which you can find by running `npm root -g`
    args:
      - '{REPLACE_WITH_NODE_MODULES_LOCATION}/@gongrzhe/image-gen-server/build/index.js'
      # Example with output from `npm root -g`:
      # - "/home/danny/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.0/lib/node_modules/@gongrzhe/image-gen-server/build/index.js"
    env:
      # Do not hardcode the API token here, use the environment variable instead
      # The following will pick up the token from your .env file or environment
      REPLICATE_API_TOKEN: '${REPLICATE_API_TOKEN}'
      MODEL: 'google/imagen-3'
```

## Image Storage and Handling

All generated images are:

1. Saved according to the configured [**`fileStrategy`**](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/config#filestrategy)
2. Displayed directly in the chat interface
3. Image tool outputs are directly sent to the LLM as part of the immediate chat context following generation.

- This may create issues if you are using an LLM that does not support image inputs.
- There will be an option to disable this behavior on a per-agent-basis in the future.
- These outputs are only directly sent to the LLM upon generation, not on every message.
- To include the image in the chat, you can directly attach it to the message from the side panel.
- To summarize, the LLM will only get vision context from images attached to user messages, and not from generations/edits, except for immediately after generation.

---

## Proxy Support

All image generation tools support proxy configuration through the `PROXY` environment variable:

```bash
PROXY=http://proxy-url:port
```

## Error Handling

If any of the tools encounter an error, they will return an error message explaining what went wrong. Common issues include:

- Invalid API key
- API unavailability
- Content policy violations
- Proxy/network issues
- Invalid parameters
- Unsupported image payload (see [Image Storage and Handling](#image-storage-and-handling) above)

---

## Prompting

Though you can customize the prompts for [OpenAI Image Tools](#advanced-configuration) and [DALL·E](#advanced-configuration-1), the following tips inform the default prompts supplied by the tools, which is helpful to know for your own writing/prompting.

1. Start with the **subject** and **style** (photo, oil painting, etc.).
2. Add **composition** and **camera / medium** ("wide-angle shot of…", "watercolour…").
3. Mention **lighting & mood** ("golden hour", "dramatic shadows").
4. Finish with **detail keywords** (textures, colours, expressions).
5. Keep negatives positive—describe what should be included, not what to avoid.

Example:

> A cinematic photo of an antique library bathed in warm afternoon sunlight. Tall wooden shelves overflow with leather-bound books, and dust particles shimmer in the light. A single green-shaded banker's lamp illuminates an open atlas on a polished mahogany desk in the foreground. 85 mm lens, shallow depth of field, rich amber tones, ultra-high detail.
