## 🎨 Image Generation & Editing

LibreChat comes with **built-in image tools** that you can add to an **[Agent](/docs/features/agents).**

Each has its own look, price-point, and setup step (usually just an API key or URL).

| Tool | Best for | Needs |
|------|----------|-------|
| **OpenAI Image Tools** | Cutting-edge results (GPT-Image-1).<br/>Can also ***edit*** the images you upload. | OpenAI API |
| **DALL·E (3 / 2)** | Legacy OpenAI Image models. | OpenAI API |
| **Stable Diffusion** | Local or self-hosted generation, endless community models. | Automatic1111 API |
| **Flux** | Fast cloud renders, optional fine-tunes. | Flux API |
| **MCP** | Bring-your-own-Image-Generators | MCP server with image output support |

**Notes:**
- API keys can be omitted in favor of allowing the user to enter their own key from the UI.
- Azure OpenAI does not yet support the latest OpenAI GPT-Image-1.
- MCP Server tool image outputs are supported, which may output images similarly to LC's built-in tools.
  - Note: MCP servers may or may not use the correct response format when outputting images. See details in the [MCP section below](#5--model-context-protocol-mcp).

## 1 · OpenAI Image Tools (recommended)

### Features

"OpenAI Image Tools" are an agent toolkit made up of 2 separate tools.

- **Image Generation**:
  - **Create** brand-new images from text prompts (no upload required).  
- **Image Editing**:
  - **Edit** or **remix** the images you just uploaded—change colours, add objects, extend the canvas, etc.
- Both use OpenAI's latest image generation model, **GPT-Image-1**, for superior instruction following, text rendering, detailed editing, real-world knowledge
- See OpenAI's [Image Generation documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/image-generation?image-generation-model=gpt-image-1) for more details.

#### Generation vs. Editing
| Use-case | Invokes |
|----------|---------------|
| "Start from scratch" | **Image Generation** |
| "Use my uploaded photo(s)" | **Image Editing** |

The agent decides automatically, but the distinction is simple:

- If the user’s last message includes image(s), the LLM can choose the "edit" tool.
- "Editing" uses all uploaded images as direct references for image generation
- Otherwise, only image generation is possible
    - Image generation is always an option in either scenario.

⚠️ **Important**
- Only the images attached to **the current user message** are sent to OpenAI for editing.  
- if the "Resend files" model parameter is toggled, previously uploaded images will stay in scope as part of the regular chat request 
  - However, the "Resend files" model parameter does not affect files for "image editing."
  - Motivation: this is to prevent the model from trying to edit images that are no longer relevant to the current context, which could lead to unexpected results.
  - You can easily attach previously uploaded images from the side panel without needing to upload them again.

### Parameters

#### Image Generation
• **prompt** – your description (required)  
• **size** – `auto` (default), `1024x1024` (square), `1536x1024` (landscape), or `1024x1536` (portrait)  
• **quality** – `auto` (default), `high`, `medium`, or `low`  
• **background** – `auto` (default), `transparent`, or `opaque` (transparent requires PNG or WebP format)

#### Image Editing

Note: The image editing tool is only available if the user has uploaded images in the current message.

• **prompt** – your description of the changes (required)  
• **size** – `auto` (default), `1024x1024`, `1536x1024`, `1024x1536`, `256x256`, or `512x512`

## 3 · Stable Diffusion (local)

Run images entirely on your own machine or server.  
Point LibreChat at any Automatic1111 (or compatible) endpoint and you're set.

### Parameters
• **prompt** – Detailed keywords describing what you want in the image (required)  
• **negative_prompt** – Keywords describing what you want to exclude from the image (required)

The Stable Diffusion implementation uses these default parameters:
- cfg_scale: 4.5
- steps: 22
- width: 1024
- height: 1024

These values are currently fixed but provide good results for most use cases.

### Setup

```bash
SD_WEBUI_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7860  # URL to your Automatic1111 WebUI
```

No API key required—just the reachable URL.

## 4 · Flux

Cloud generator with an emphasis on speed and optional fine-tuned models.

### Features
- Fast cloud-based image generation
- Support for fine-tuned models
- Multiple quality levels and aspect ratios
- Raw mode for less processed, more natural-looking images

### Parameters
The Flux tool supports three main actions:

1. **generate** - Create a new image from a text prompt
2. **generate_finetuned** - Create an image using a fine-tuned model
3. **list_finetunes** - List available custom models for the user

For `generate` action:

• **prompt** – Text description for the image (required)  
• **width** – Width in pixels (multiple of 32)  
• **height** – Height in pixels (multiple of 32)  
• **prompt_upsampling** – Whether to perform upsampling on the prompt (default: false)  
• **steps** – Number of diffusion steps (1-50, default: 40)  
• **seed** – Optional seed for reproducibility  
• **safety_tolerance** – Tolerance level for moderation (0-6, default: 6)  
• **endpoint** – Model endpoint to use:
  - `/v1/flux-pro-1.1` (default)
  - `/v1/flux-pro`
  - `/v1/flux-dev`
  - `/v1/flux-pro-1.1-ultra`
• **raw** – Generate less processed images (only for ultra endpoint, default: false)

For `generate_finetuned` action:

• All parameters from `generate` plus:  
• **finetune_id** – ID of the fine-tuned model (required)  
• **finetune_strength** – Strength of the fine-tuning effect (0.1-1.2, default: 1.1)  
• **guidance** – Guidance scale (default: 2.5)  
• **aspect_ratio** – Aspect ratio for ultra models (default: "16:9")  
• **endpoint** – Must be one of:
  - `/v1/flux-pro-finetuned` (default)

## 5 · Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Image outputs are supported from MCP servers.

For example, the [Puppeteer MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/puppeteer) can be used to generate screenshots of web pages, which correctly output the image in the expected format and is treated the same as LC's built-in image tools.

> The examples below assume LibreChat is running outside of Docker, directly using Node.js. The Model Context Protocol is a relatively new framework, and many developers are still learning how to properly serve their systems with uv/node for scalable distribution.

> As this technology is still emerging, there are currently few image-generating servers available, and many existing ones have yet to adopt the correct response format for images.

> While many MCP servers do function well within Docker, the following examples do not, or not without more advanced configurations, showcasing some of the current inconsistency between MCP servers.

```yaml
mcpServers:
  puppeteer:
    command: npx
    args:
      - -y
      - "@modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer"
```

The following is an example of an [Image Generation server](https://github.com/GongRzhe/Image-Generation-MCP-Server) that outputs images using [Replicate API](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens), but returns URLs of the images, which doesn't conform to MCP's image response standard.

> Note: for this particular server, you need to install the `@gongrzhe/image-gen-server` package globally using npm, i.e. `npm install -g @gongrzhe/image-gen-server`, then point to the package's compiled files as shown below.

```yaml
mcpServers:
  image-gen:
    command: "node"
    # First, install the package globally using npm:
    # `npm install -g @gongrzhe/image-gen-server`
    # Then, point to the location of the installed package,
    # which you can find by running `npm root -g`
    args:
      - "{REPLACE_WITH_NODE_MODULES_LOCATION}/@gongrzhe/image-gen-server/build/index.js"
      # Example with output from `npm root -g`:
      # - "/home/danny/.nvm/versions/node/v20.19.0/lib/node_modules/@gongrzhe/image-gen-server/build/index.js"
    env:
      # Do not hardcode the API token here, use the environment variable instead
      # The following will pick up the token from your .env file or environment
      REPLICATE_API_TOKEN: "${REPLICATE_API_TOKEN}"
      MODEL: "google/imagen-3"
```

## Image Storage and Handling

All generated images are:
1. Saved according to the configured [**`fileStrategy`**](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/config#filestrategy)
2. Displayed directly in the chat interface

---

## Proxy Support

All image generation tools support proxy configuration through the `PROXY` environment variable:

```bash
PROXY=http://your-proxy-url:port
```

## Error Handling
If any of the tools encounter an error, they will return an error message explaining what went wrong. Common issues include:
- Invalid API key
- API unavailability
- Content policy violations
- Proxy/network issues
- Invalid parameters

---

## Prompting

Though you can customize the prompts for [OpenAI Image Tools](#advanced-configuration) and [DALL·E](#advanced-configuration-1), the following tips inform the default prompts supplied by the tools, which is helpful to know for your own writing/prompting.

1. Start with the **subject** and **style** (photo, oil painting, etc.).  
2. Add **composition** and **camera / medium** ("wide-angle shot of…", "watercolour…").  
3. Mention **lighting & mood** ("golden hour", "dramatic shadows").  
4. Finish with **detail keywords** (textures, colours, expressions).  
5. Keep negatives positive—describe what you *want*, not what to avoid.

Example:  

> A cinematic photo of an antique library bathed in warm afternoon sunlight. Tall wooden shelves overflow with leather-bound books, and dust particles shimmer in the light. A single green-shaded banker's lamp illuminates an open atlas on a polished mahogany desk in the foreground. 85 mm lens, shallow depth of field, rich amber tones, ultra-high detail.
