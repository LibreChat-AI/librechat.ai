# Agents: Build Custom AI Assistants

LibreChat's AI Agents feature provides a flexible framework for creating custom AI assistants powered by various model providers.

This feature is similar to OpenAI's Assistants API and ChatGPT's GPTs, but with broader model support and a no-code implementation, letting you build sophisticated assistants with specialized capabilities.

## Getting Started

To create a new agent, select "Agents" from the endpoint menu and open the Agent Builder panel found in the Side Panel.

![Agents - Endpoints Menu](/images/agents/endpoints_menu.png)

The creation form includes:

- **Avatar**: Upload a custom avatar to personalize your agent
- **Name**: Choose a distinctive name for your agent
- **Description**: Optional details about your agent's purpose
- **Instructions**: System instructions that define your agent's behavior
- **Model**: Select from available providers and models

**Existing agents can be selected from the top dropdown of the Side Panel.**
- **Also by mention with "@" in the chat input.**

### Model Configuration

The model parameters interface allows fine-tuning of your agent's responses:

- Temperature (0-1 scale for response creativity)
- Max context tokens
- Max output tokens
- Additional provider-specific settings

## Agent Capabilities

> **Note:** All capabilities can be toggled via the `librechat.yaml` configuration file. See [docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/agents#capabilities](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/agents#capabilities) for more information.

### Code Interpreter

When enabled, the Code Interpreter capability allows your agent to:
- Execute code in multiple languages, including:
  - Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, C, C++, Java, PHP, Rust, and Fortran
- Process files securely through the LibreChat Code Interpreter API
- Run code without local setup, configuration, or sandbox deployment
- Handle file uploads and downloads seamlessly
- [More info about the Code Interpreter API](/docs/features/code_interpreter)
  - **Requires an API Subscription from [code.librechat.ai](https://code.librechat.ai/pricing)**

### File Search

The File Search capability enables:
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality
- Semantic search across uploaded documents
- Context-aware responses based on file contents
- File attachment support at both agent and chat thread levels

### File Context (using Optical Character Recognition)

The File Context (OCR) capability allows your agent to extract and process text from images and documents:

- Extract text while maintaining document structure and formatting
- Process complex layouts including multi-column text and mixed content
- Handle tables, equations, and other specialized content
- Work with multilingual content
- [More info about OCR](/docs/features/ocr)
  - **Currently uses Mistral OCR API which may incur costs**

### Artifacts

The Artifacts capability enables your agent to generate and display interactive content:

- Create React components, HTML code, and Mermaid diagrams
- Display content in a separate UI window for clarity and interaction
- Configure artifact-specific instructions at the agent level
- [More info about Artifacts](/docs/features/artifacts)

When enabled, additional instructions specific to the use of artifacts are added by default. Options include:

- **Enable shadcn/ui instructions**: Adds instructions for using shadcn/ui components (a collection of re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS)
- **Custom Prompt Mode**: When enabled, the default artifacts system prompt will not be included, allowing you to provide your own custom instructions

Configuring artifacts at the agent level is the preferred approach, as it allows for more granular control compared to the legacy app-wide configuration.

If you enable Custom Prompt Mode, you should include at minimum the basic artifact format in your instructions.

Here's a simple example of the minimum instructions needed:

````md
When creating content that should be displayed as an artifact, use the following format:

:::artifact{identifier="unique-identifier" type="mime-type" title="Artifact Title"}
```
Your artifact content here
```
:::

For the type attribute, use one of:
- "text/html" for HTML content
- "application/vnd.mermaid" for Mermaid diagrams
- "application/vnd.react" for React components
- "image/svg+xml" for SVG images
````

### Tools

Agents can also be enhanced with various built-in tools:

- **[OpenAI Image Tools](/docs/features/image_gen#1--openai-image-tools-recommended)**: Image generation & editing using **[GPT-Image-1](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-image-1)**
- **[DALL-E-3](/docs/features/image_gen#2--dalle-legacy)**: Image generation from text descriptions
- **[Stable Diffusion](/docs/features/image_gen#3--stable-diffusion-local)** / **[Flux](/docs/features/image_gen#4--flux)**: Text-to-image generation
- **[Wolfram](/docs/configuration/tools/wolfram)**: Computational and mathematical capabilities
- **[OpenWeather](/docs/configuration/tools/openweather)**: Weather data retrieval
- **[Google Search](/docs/configuration/tools/google_search)**: Access to web search functionality
- **Calculator**: Mathematical calculations
- **Tavily Search**: Advanced search API with diverse data source integration
- **Azure AI Search**: Information retrieval
- **Traversaal**: A robust search API for LLM Agents

- Tools can be disabled using the [`librechat.yaml`](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml) configuration file:
  - [More info](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/agents#capabilities)

### Actions

With the Actions capability, you can dynamically create tools from [OpenAPI specs](https://swagger.io/specification/) to add to your Agents.

![Agents - Endpoints Menu](/images/agents/actions.png)

**Clicking the button above will open a form where you can input the OpenAPI spec URL and create an action:**

![Agents - Endpoints Menu](/images/agents/actions_panel.png)

- Actions can be disabled using the [`librechat.yaml`](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml) configuration file:
  - [More info](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/agents#capabilities)
- Individual domains can be whitelisted for agent actions:
  - [More info](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/actions#alloweddomains)
- Note that you can add add the 'x-strict': true flag at operation-level in the OpenAPI spec for actions.
If using an OpenAI model supporting it, this will automatically generate function calls with 'strict' mode enabled.
  - Strict mode supports only a partial subset of json. Read https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/some-type-specific-keywords-are-not-yet-supported for details.

### Agent Chain

The Agent Chain capability enables a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) approach, allowing you to create a sequence of agents that work together:

- Create chains of specialized agents for complex tasks
- Each agent in the chain can access outputs from previous agents
- Configure the maximum number of steps for the agent chain
- **Note:** Access this feature from the Advanced Settings panel in the Agent Builder
- **Note:** This feature is currently in beta and may be subject to change
  - The current maximum of agents that can be chained is 10, but this may be configurable in the future

<img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/superb-reporter-407417.appspot.com/o/agent_chain.png?alt=media&token=bfa209b9-d2ab-403f-b097-6300b4017fc8" alt="Agent Chain" width={488} height={269}/>

This feature introduces a layered Mixture-of-Agents architecture to LibreChat, where each agent takes all the outputs from agents in the previous layer as auxiliary information in generating its response, as described in [the eponymous "Mixture-of-Agents" paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04692).

### Advanced Settings

Advanced settings for your agent (found in the Advanced view of the Agent form) outside of "capabilities."

#### Max Agent Steps

This setting allows you to limit the number of steps an agent can take in a "run," which refers to the agent loop before a final response is given.

If left unconfigured, the default is 25 steps, but you can adjust this to suit your needs. For admins, you can set a global default as well as a global maximum in the [`librechat.yaml`](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/agents#recursionlimit) file.

A "step" refers to either an AI API request or a round of tool usage (1 or many tools, depending on how many tool calls the LLM provides from a single request).

A single, non-tool response is 1 step. A singular round of tool usage is usually 3 steps:

1. API Request -> 2. Tool Usage (1 or many tools) -> 3. Follow-up API Request

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs), acting like a universal adapter for AI tools and data sources.

Imagine MCP as the "USB-C of AI" - just as USB-C provides a universal connection standard for electronic devices, MCP offers a standardized way to connect AI models to diverse tools, data sources, and services.

By configuring `mcpServers` in the `librechat.yaml` file, you can:
- Add custom tools from various sources
- Integrate specialized data access tools
- Extend AI capabilities beyond default offerings

Here are some tools added by configuring the ["Filesystem" MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem):
![Agents - MCP](/images/agents/mcp_tools.png)

Key Features:
- Upon app restart, tools are available in the "Add Tools" button within the Agent Builder panel
- Seamlessly connect custom tools and data sources
- Leverage a growing ecosystem of MCP-compatible servers and integrations

#### MCP Server Types and Multi-User Support

MCP servers can be configured to use different transport mechanisms:

**STDIO Servers**
- Work well for local, single-user environments
- Not scalable for remote or cloud deployments
- Limited multi-user support

**Server-Sent Events (SSE) Servers**
- More scalable transport mechanism for multi-user environments
- Enhanced multi-user support with user-specific connections

**Streamable HTTP Servers**
- Uses HTTP POST for sending messages and supports streaming responses
- Operates as an independent process that can handle multiple client connections
- Supports both basic requests and streaming via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- More performant alternative to the legacy HTTP+SSE transport
- Supports proper multi-user server configurations

**Multi-User Features**
- User-level and app-level connections with proper establishment and cleanup
- MCP Servers can distinguish connections by session ID
- Dynamic user field placeholders in headers, URLs, and environment variables:
  - `{{LIBRECHAT_USER_ID}}` - User's unique identifier
  - Basic fields: `{{LIBRECHAT_USER_EMAIL}}`, `{{LIBRECHAT_USER_USERNAME}}`, `{{LIBRECHAT_USER_NAME}}`, `{{LIBRECHAT_USER_ROLE}}`, `{{LIBRECHAT_USER_PROVIDER}}`
  - Provider IDs: `{{LIBRECHAT_USER_GOOGLEID}}`, `{{LIBRECHAT_USER_OPENIDID}}`, `{{LIBRECHAT_USER_SAMLID}}`, `{{LIBRECHAT_USER_LDAPID}}`, etc.
  - Boolean fields: `{{LIBRECHAT_USER_EMAILVERIFIED}}`, `{{LIBRECHAT_USER_TWOFACTORENABLED}}`, `{{LIBRECHAT_USER_TERMSACCEPTED}}`
  - See [MCP Servers documentation](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/mcp_servers#headers) for complete field list
- Environment variable support: `${SOME_API_KEY}`
- User idle timeout management for efficient resource usage

**Example Configuration:**
```yaml
mcpServers:
  googlesheets:
    type: sse
    url: https://mcp.composio.dev/googlesheets/some-endpoint
    headers:
      X-User-ID: "{{LIBRECHAT_USER_ID}}"
      X-User-Email: "{{LIBRECHAT_USER_EMAIL}}"
      X-API-Key: "${SOME_API_KEY}"
  
  streamable-http-example:
    type: streamable-http
    url: https://example.com/mcp/users/{{LIBRECHAT_USER_USERNAME}}
    headers:
      X-User-ID: "{{LIBRECHAT_USER_ID}}"
      X-User-Role: "{{LIBRECHAT_USER_ROLE}}"
      Authorization: "Bearer ${API_TOKEN}"
  
  user-context-server:
    type: stdio
    command: node
    args: ["server.js"]
    env:
      USER_EMAIL: "{{LIBRECHAT_USER_EMAIL}}"
      USER_PROVIDER: "{{LIBRECHAT_USER_PROVIDER}}"
      API_KEY: "${MCP_API_KEY}"
```

LibreChat is at the forefront of implementing flexible, scalable MCP server integrations to support diverse usage scenarios.

For detailed configuration options, see [Configuring MCP Servers](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/mcp_servers).

## File Management

Agents support four distinct file upload categories:

1. **Image Upload**: For visual content processing
2. **File Search Upload**: Documents for RAG capabilities
3. **Code Interpreter Upload**: Files for code processing
4. **File Context (OCR)**: Documents processed with OCR and added to the agent's instructions

Files can be attached directly to the agent configuration or within individual chat threads.

![File Context using OCR for agents](/images/ocr/file_context_ocr.png)

Files uploaded as "File Context" are processed using OCR to extract text, which is then added to the Agent's instructions. This is ideal for documents, images with text, or PDFs where you need the full text content of a file to be available to the agent. Note, the OCR is performed at the time of upload and is not stored as a separate file, rather purely as text in the database.

## Sharing and Permissions

### Administrator Controls

Administrators have access to global permission settings within the agent builder UI:

- Enable/disable agent sharing across all users
- Control agent usage permissions
- Manage agent creation rights
- Configure platform-wide settings

The first account created for your instance is an administrator. If you need to add an additional administrator, you may [access MongoDB](/docs/configuration/mongodb/mongodb_auth) and update the user's profile:

```
db.users.updateOne(
  { email: 'USER_EMAIL_ADDRESS' },
  { $set: { role: 'ADMIN' } }
)
```

The use of agents for all users can also be disabled via config, [more info](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/interface).

### User-Level Sharing

Individual users can:
- Share their agents with all users (if enabled)
- Control editing permissions for shared agents
- Manage access to their created agents

### Notes

- Instructions, model parameters, attached files, and tools are only exposed to the user if they have editing permissions
  - An agent may leak any attached data, whether instructions or files, through conversation--make sure your instructions are robust against this
- Only original authors and administrators can delete shared agents
- Agents are private to authors unless shared

## Optional Configuration

LibreChat allows admins to configure the use of agents via the [`librechat.yaml`](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml) file:

- Disable Agents for all users (including admins): [more info](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/interface)
- Customize agent capabilities using: [more info](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/agents)

## Best Practices

- Provide clear, specific instructions for your agent
- Carefully consider which tools are necessary for your use case
- Organize files appropriately across the four upload categories
- Review permission settings before sharing agents
- Test your agent thoroughly before deploying to other users

## Recap

1. Select "Agents" from the endpoint dropdown menu
2. Open the Agent Builder panel
3. Fill out the required agent details
4. Configure desired capabilities (Code Interpreter, File Search, File Context or OCR)
5. Add necessary tools and files
6. Set sharing permissions if desired
7. Create and start using your agent

## What's next?

LibreChat Agents usher in a new era for the app where future pipelines can be streamlined via Agents for specific tasks and workflows across your experience in LibreChat.

Future updates will include:
- General improvements to the current Agent experience
- Multi-agent orchestration for complex workflows
- Ability to customize agents for various functions: titling (chat thread naming), memory management (user context/history), and prompt enhancement (input assistance/predictions)
- More tools, configurable tool parameters, dynamic tool creation.

Furthermore, the update introduces a new paradigm for LibreChat, as its underlying architecture provides a much needed refresh for the app, optimizing both the user experience and overall app performance.

To highlight one notable optimization, an AI generation of roughly 1000 tokens will transfer about 1 MB of data using traditional endpoints (at the time of writing, any endpoint option besides Agents and AWS Bedrock).

Using an agent, the same generation will transfer about about 52 kb of data, a 95% reduction in data transfer, which is that much less of a load on the server and the user's device.
