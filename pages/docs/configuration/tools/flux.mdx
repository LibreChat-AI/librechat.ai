# Flux Image Generation

Flux is a powerful image generation tool that can create high-quality images from text descriptions. It supports various artistic styles and offers extensive customization options.

## Setup Instructions

1. Get your API key from [bfl.ml](https://bfl.ml)
2. Set the `FLUX_API_KEY` environment variable in your `.env` file:
```bash
FLUX_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- Generate high-quality images from detailed text descriptions
- Support for multiple artistic styles
- Customizable image dimensions
- Adjustable generation parameters
- Multiple endpoint options for different use cases
- Batch generation support (up to 24 images)

### Available Endpoints
- `/v1/flux-pro` - Standard endpoint (default)
- `/v1/flux-pro-1.1` - Enhanced version
- `/v1/flux-dev` - Development version
- `/v1/flux-pro-1.1-ultra` - Premium quality endpoint

### Parameters

The Flux tool supports three main actions:

1. **generate** - Create a new image from a text prompt
2. **generate_finetuned** - Create an image using a fine-tuned model
3. **list_finetunes** - List available custom models for the user


For `generate` action:

• **prompt** – Text description for the image (required)  
• **width** – Width in pixels (multiple of 32)  
• **height** – Height in pixels (multiple of 32)  
• **prompt_upsampling** – Whether to perform upsampling on the prompt (default: false)  
• **steps** – Number of diffusion steps (1-50, default: 40)  
• **seed** – Optional seed for reproducibility  
• **safety_tolerance** – Tolerance level for moderation (0-6, default: 6)  
• **endpoint** – Model endpoint to use:
  - `/v1/flux-pro-1.1` (default)
  - `/v1/flux-pro`
  - `/v1/flux-dev`
  - `/v1/flux-pro-1.1-ultra`
• **raw** – Generate less processed images (only for ultra endpoint, default: false)

For `generate_finetuned` action:

• All parameters from `generate` plus:  
• **finetune_id** – ID of the fine-tuned model (required)  
• **finetune_strength** – Strength of the fine-tuning effect (0.1-1.2, default: 1.1)  
• **guidance** – Guidance scale (default: 2.5)  
• **aspect_ratio** – Aspect ratio for ultra models (default: "16:9")  
• **endpoint** – Must be one of:
  - `/v1/flux-pro-finetuned` (default)
  - `/v1/flux-pro-1.1-ultra-finetuned`


## Best Practices

### Prompt Writing
1. Be specific and detailed in descriptions
2. Include key elements:
   - Subject matter
   - Style and artistic approach
   - Composition details
   - Lighting and atmosphere
   - Color preferences
   - Technical specifications

### Tips for Best Results
- Write prompts in English
- Balance specificity with creative freedom
- Avoid conflicting concepts
- Focus on visual descriptions
- Consider composition layers (foreground, middle ground, background)

## Technical Details

### Image Processing
- Images are automatically saved and managed
- Supports PNG output format
- Includes built-in moderation and safety features
- Asynchronous generation with status tracking

### Integration Features
- Seamless integration with chat interfaces
- Markdown-formatted output
- Built-in error handling and logging
- Support for batch processing

## Usage Examples

Here are some example prompts that work well with Flux:

> A serene mountain landscape at sunset, with snow-capped peaks reflected in a crystal-clear alpine lake. Warm golden light illuminates wispy clouds, creating a dramatic atmosphere. Photorealistic style with rich colors and sharp details.

> A futuristic cityscape at night, featuring neon-lit skyscrapers and flying vehicles. Cyberpunk style with deep blues and purples, accented by bright neon colors. Rain-slicked streets reflect the city lights, creating a moody atmosphere.

## Error Handling

Common error messages and solutions:
- API key issues: Verify your API key is correctly set in environment variables
- Generation failures: Check prompt length and content guidelines
- Timeout errors: May occur during high server load, retry after a brief wait

## Rate Limits and Usage

- Free tier includes generous usage limits
- Multiple images can be generated in a single request
- Consider using lower step counts for faster generations during testing
