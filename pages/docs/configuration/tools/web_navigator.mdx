# WebNavigator Plugin Configuration

The WebNavigator plugin provides web navigation capabilities similar to cURL, allowing you to make HTTP requests with various methods and parameters. It's designed to fetch and process web content with customizable options for filtering and handling the response.

## Prerequisites

- No API key required
- LibreChat installation

## Configuration

No special configuration is required. The WebNavigator plugin works out of the box once LibreChat is properly installed.

### Plugin Configuration

Add the plugin to any [agent](https://www.librechat.ai/docs/features/agents)

## Usage

The WebNavigator plugin allows you to make HTTP requests with various customization options:

### Key Features

- Make HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Browser impersonation
- Custom headers and cookies
- Query parameter handling
- HTML content filtering
- Text-only response options

### Parameters

- `url` (required): The URL to send the request to
- `method`: HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- `params`: Query parameters as key-value pairs
- `data`: Body data for POST/PUT requests
- `headers`: Custom HTTP headers
- `cookies`: Cookie string to include with the request
- `browserImpersonation`: Choose browser to impersonate ("plain", "firefox", "safari", "chrome")
- `returnTextOnly`: Get text content without HTML tags
- `excludeTags`: Array of HTML tags to remove from response
- `returnOnlyTags`: Array of specific HTML tags to keep
- `includeAttributes`: Array of HTML attributes to preserve
- `includeHrefTargets`: Include list of href targets from response
- `fetchRelated`: Fetch related non-binary links

### Example Prompts

```
Can you fetch the main content from example.com?
Get the text content from wikipedia.org/wiki/Python without any HTML
Visit example.com and show me all the links
Make a POST request to api.example.com with this JSON data
Get the page content while pretending to be Firefox
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **403 Forbidden Errors**
   - Try using browser impersonation
   - Check if the site blocks automated access
   - Ensure any required cookies are included

2. **Content Not Loading**
   - Verify the URL is accessible
   - Check if JavaScript is required (not supported)
   - Try different browser impersonation options

3. **Missing Content**
   - Adjust excludeTags/returnOnlyTags parameters
   - Check if content is dynamically loaded
   - Verify the content exists in the HTML response

## Limitations

- JavaScript execution is not supported
- Some websites may block automated access
- Binary file downloads are not supported
- Response size may be limited
- Dynamic content requiring JavaScript won't be available

## Notes

- Default behavior excludes style, script, and other non-content tags
- Browser impersonation can help bypass some access restrictions
- Consider rate limiting when making multiple requests
- Some websites may have terms of service restricting automated access
