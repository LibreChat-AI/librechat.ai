# Tools and Plugins

**Note:** A new approach has been devised to revamp the handling of tools and plugins from scratch. The plan is to prioritize implementation for Assistants initially, followed by creating a new agent system that seamlessly integrates with various endpoints such as Anthropic, Google, and others.

## Setup Instructions:

### Azure AI Search
- [Azure AI Search](/docs/configuration/tools/azure_ai_search)

### Google Search
- [Google Search](/docs/configuration/tools/google_search)

### Stable Diffusion
- [Stable Diffusion](/docs/configuration/tools/stable_diffusion)

### Wolfram|Alpha
- [Wolfram|Alpha](/docs/configuration/tools/wolfram)

### DALL-E
- You just need an OpenAI key, and it's made distinct from your main API key to make Chats but it can be the same one

### Zapier
- You need a Zapier account. Get your **[API key from here](https://nla.zapier.com/credentials/)** after you've made an account
  - Create allowed actions - Follow step 3 in this **[Start Here guide](https://nla.zapier.com/start/)** from Zapier
    - ⚠️ NOTE: zapier is known to be finicky with certain actions. I found that writing email drafts is probably the best use of it

### Browser/Scraper
- This is not to be confused with 'browsing' on chat.openai.com (which is technically a plugin suite or multiple plugins)
  - This plugin uses OpenAI embeddings so an OpenAI key is necessary, similar to DALL-E, and it's made distinct from your main API key to make Chats but it can be the same one
  - This plugin will simply scrape html, and will not work with dynamic Javascript pages as that would require a more involved solution
  - A better solution for 'browsing' is planned but can't guarantuee when
  - This plugin is best used in combination with google so it doesn't hallucinate webpages to visit

### SerpAPI
- An alternative to Google search but not as performant in my opinion
  - You can get an API key here: **[https://serpapi.com/dashboard](https://serpapi.com/dashboard)**
  - For free tier, you are limited to 100 queries/month
  - With google, you are limited to 100/day for free, which is a better deal, and any after may cost you a few pennies
