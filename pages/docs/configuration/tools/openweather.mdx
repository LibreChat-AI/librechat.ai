# OpenWeather Plugin Configuration

The OpenWeather plugin allows you to get weather data including current conditions, forecasts, historical data, and daily summaries using OpenWeather's One Call API 3.0.

## Prerequisites

- An OpenWeather account
- An OpenWeather API key (specifically for the One Call API 3.0)

## Getting an API Key

1. Sign up for an OpenWeather account at [OpenWeather](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up)
2. After signing in, go to your [API keys](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys) page
3. Generate a new API key if you don't have one
4. Subscribe to the [One Call API 3.0](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3) plan
5. Wait for your API key to be activated (can take up to 2 hours)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

The OpenWeather plugin supports the following actions:

- `current_forecast`: Get current weather and forecast data
- `timestamp`: Get historical weather data for a specific date
- `daily_aggregation`: Get aggregated weather data for a specific date
- `overview`: Get a human-readable weather summary

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **403 Unauthorized Error**
   - Verify your API key is correct
   - Check if your API key has been activated (wait 2 hours after creation)
   - Ensure you have subscribed to the One Call API 3.0

2. **City Not Found**
   - Check the spelling of the city name
   - Try adding the country code (e.g., "London,UK")
   - Use latitude and longitude coordinates instead

3. **Invalid Date Format**
   - Ensure dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format
   - Historical data is only available from 1979-01-01
   - Future data is limited to 1.5 years ahead
