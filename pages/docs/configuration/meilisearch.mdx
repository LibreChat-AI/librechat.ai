# Setting up MeiliSearch for LibreChat
- See: [Search feature in LibreChat](/docs/user_guides/search) for a quick overview.

MeiliSearch is a powerful, open-source search engine that enhances LibreChat's functionality by enabling full-text search, typo tolerance, and instant search results for past conversations. 

Follow these steps to set up MeiliSearch for LibreChat:

## 1. Download MeiliSearch
    - Go to the MeiliSearch GitHub releases page: https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch/releases
    - Download the latest version of MeiliSearch for your operating system (e.g., `meilisearch-linux-amd64.tar.gz` for Linux, `meilisearch-macos-amd64` for macOS, or `meilisearch-windows-amd64.zip` for Windows).

## 2. Extract/Install MeiliSearch
    - Linux/macOS: Extract the downloaded archive to a directory of your choice.
    - Windows: Extract the ZIP file to a directory of your choice.

## 3. Make the MeiliSearch Binary Executable (Linux/macOS)
    - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you extracted MeiliSearch.
    - Run the following command to make the binary executable:
        ```sh filename="Make the MeiliSearch Binary Executable"
        chmod +x meilisearch
        ```

## 4. Generate a Master Key
    - Open a terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and navigate to the MeiliSearch directory.
    - Run the following command to generate a Master Key:
        ```sh filename="Generate a Master Key"
        ./meilisearch --generate-master-key
        ```
    - Copy the generated Master Key as you'll need it later.

## 5. Start MeiliSearch
    - In the same terminal, run the following command to start MeiliSearch, replacing `<your_master_key>` with the Master Key you generated in the previous step:
        ```sh filename="Start MeiliSearch"
        ./meilisearch --master-key=<your_master_key>
        ```
    - MeiliSearch will now start running on the default port (`7700`).

## 6. Update LibreChat's Environment Variables
    - Open the `.env` file in the root directory of your LibreChat project.
    - Add or update the following lines with your MeiliSearch configuration:

        ```sh filename=".env"
        SEARCH=true
        MEILI_NO_ANALYTICS=true
        MEILI_HOST=http://localhost:7700
        MEILI_MASTER_KEY=<your_master_key>
        ```

    - Replace `<your_master_key>` with the Master Key you generated earlier.

## 7. Start/Restart LibreChat
    - Start or restart your LibreChat application.

That's it! With MeiliSearch set up and configured, LibreChat should now have the Conversation search feature enabled, allowing users to perform full-text searches, benefit from typo tolerance, and experience instant search results for their past conversations.

Note: Make sure to keep the MeiliSearch process running in the background for the search functionality to work correctly. You may want to set up a script or service to keep MeiliSearch running persistently.
