# AWS Bedrock

Head to the [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/getting-started.html) to sign up for AWS and setup your credentials.

Youâ€™ll also need to turn on model access for your account, which you can do by [following these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html).

- You will need to set the following environment variables:

```bash filename=".env"
BEDROCK_AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
BEDROCK_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
BEDROCK_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
```

Note: Other ways to authenticate are still in development.

- You can optionally specify which models you want to make available with `BEDROCK_AWS_MODELS`:

```bash filename=".env"
BEDROCK_AWS_MODELS=anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0,meta.llama3-1-8b-instruct-v1:0
```

Note: If omitted, all known, supported model IDs will be included automatically.

- See all Bedrock model IDs here:
    - **[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-ids.html#model-ids-arns](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-ids.html#model-ids-arns)**

## Additional Configuration

You can further configure the Bedrock endpoint in your [`librechat.yaml`](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/) file:

```yaml
endpoints:
  bedrock:
    availableRegions:
      - "us-east-1"
      - "us-west-2"
    streamRate: 35
    titleModel: 'anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0'
```

- `streamRate`: (Optional) Set the rate of processing each new token in milliseconds.
    - This can help stabilize processing of concurrent requests and provide smoother frontend stream rendering.

- `titleModel`: (Optional) Specify the model to use for generating conversation titles.
    - Recommended: `anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0`.
    - Omit or set as `current_model` to use the same model as the chat.

- `availableRegions`: (Optional) Specify the AWS regions you want to make available.
    - If provided, users will see a dropdown to select the region. If not selected, the default region is used.
