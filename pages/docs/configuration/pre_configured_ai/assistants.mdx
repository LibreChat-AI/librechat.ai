# Assistants

- The [Assistants API by OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) has a dedicated endpoint.
- The Assistants API enables the creation of AI assistants, offering functionalities like code interpreter, knowledge retrieval of files, and function execution.
  - [Read here for an in-depth documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) of the feature, how it works, what it's capable of.
- As with the regular [OpenAI API](/docs/configuration/pre_configured_ai/openai), go to **[https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)** to get a key.
- You will need to set the following environment variable to your key or you can set it to `user_provided` for users to provide their own.

```bash filename=".env"
ASSISTANTS_API_KEY=your-key
```

- You can determine which models you would like to have available with `ASSISTANTS_MODELS`; otherwise, the models list fetched from OpenAI will be used (only Assistants API compatible models will be shown).

```bash filename=".env"
ASSISTANTS_MODELS=gpt-3.5-turbo-0125,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k-0613,gpt-3.5-turbo-16k,gpt-3.5-turbo,gpt-4,gpt-4-0314,gpt-4-32k-0314,gpt-4-0613,gpt-3.5-turbo-0613,gpt-3.5-turbo-1106,gpt-4-0125-preview,gpt-4-turbo-preview,gpt-4-1106-preview
```

- If necessary, you can also set an alternate base URL instead of the official one with `ASSISTANTS_BASE_URL`, which is similar to the OpenAI counterpart `OPENAI_REVERSE_PROXY`

```bash filename=".env"
ASSISTANTS_BASE_URL=http://your-alt-baseURL:3080/
```

- There is additional, optional configuration, depending on your needs, such as disabling the assistant builder UI, that are available via the `librechat.yaml` [custom config file](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/assistants_endpoint):
  - Control the visibility and use of the builder interface for assistants. [More info](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/assistants_endpoint#disablebuilder)
  - Specify the polling interval in milliseconds for checking run updates or changes in assistant run states. [More info](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/assistants_endpoint#pollintervalms)
  - Set the timeout period in milliseconds for assistant runs. Helps manage system load by limiting total run operation time. [More info](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/assistants_endpoint#timeoutms)
  - Specify which assistant Ids are supported or excluded [More info](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/assistants_endpoint#supportedids)

## Strict function calling

With librechat you can add add the 'x-strict': true flag at operation-level in the openapi spec for actions.
This will automatically generate function calls with 'strict' mode enabled.
Note that strict mode supports only a partial subset of json. Read https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs/some-type-specific-keywords-are-not-yet-supported for details.

For example:
