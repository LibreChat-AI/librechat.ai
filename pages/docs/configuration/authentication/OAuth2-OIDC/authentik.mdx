# Authentik

1. **Access Authentik Admin Interface:**
- Open the Authentik Admin Interface in your browser. Can be found at a URL such as: `https://authentik.example.com/if/admin/#/administration/overview`.
> We will use `https://authentik.example.com` as an example URL. Replace this with the URL of your Authentik instance.

2. **Create a new Application and Provider using the wizard:**
- Click on the Applications tab in the left sidebar and click on Applications again.
- At the top of the page you should see a button that says `Create with Wizard`. Click on it.
> Note: You can also create an application and provider manually just be sure to link them afterwards.
- You can name the application whatever you want. For this example, we will name it `LibreChat` and click next.
- Choose the `OAuth2/OIDC` provider and click next.
- Choose your authentication and authorization flows.
- Scroll down and take note of the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`. You will need these later.
- Under Advanced protocol settings change Subject mode to `Based on the User's Email`.
- Click Submit.
- Add the new application you created to an Outpost.
> Note: You should also apply any policies for access control that you want to apply to LibreChat at this point.

3. **Gather Information for .env:**
- You will need the following information from Authentik:
  - `Client ID`
  - `Client Secret`
  - `OpenID Configuration URL`
  > All of these can be found by clicking on the provider you just created.

3. **Configure LibreChat:**
- Open the `.env` file and add the following variables:
```bash filename=".env"
OPENID_ISSUER=https://authentik.example.com/application/o/librechat/.well-known/openid-configuration
OPENID_CLIENT_ID=[YourClientID]
OPENID_CLIENT_SECRET=[YourClientSecret]
OPENID_SESSION_SECRET=[JustGenerateARandomSessionSecret]
OPENID_CALLBACK_URL=/oauth/openid/callback
OPENID_SCOPE=openid profile email
# Optional customization below
OPENID_BUTTON_LABEL=Login with Authentik
OPENID_IMAGE_URL=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/selfhst/icons/png/authentik.png
# Redirects the user to the end session endpoint after logging out
OPENID_USE_END_SESSION_ENDPOINT=true 
```
> Note: Make sure nothing is wrapped in quotes in your .env and you have allowed social login.

4. **Check Configuration:**
- Restart LibreChat to apply the changes.
- Open an Icognito window and navigate to your LibreChat instance.
- Underneath the form login there should be a new button that says `Login with Authentik`.
- You should be redirected to Authentik to login.
- After logging in you should be redirected back to LibreChat and be logged in.
    - If you are not redirected back to LibreChat, check Authentik logs for any errors.
