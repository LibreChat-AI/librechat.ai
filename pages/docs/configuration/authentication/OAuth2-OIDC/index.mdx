## OpenID Custom fields
LibreChat supports more than just basic OpenID authentication. It also lets you retrieve additional organizational data—such as department or role information—from your OpenID provider. This means you can enrich your user records with extra fields beyond the default ones.

### To enable this feature:

1. Identify the Extra Data:
Decide which additional fields (for example, department, role, etc.) you’d like to store in your users table. These fields come from your OpenID provider’s response.

2. Configure Environment Variables:
In your environment file (commonly named .env), you can set two specific variables:

**OPENID_CUSTOM_DATA**: This variable lists the names of the custom fields you wish to fetch.
**OPENID_CUSTOM_DATA_PROVIDER**: This variable tells LibreChat which provider or endpoint to use for retrieving these additional data fields.

**Outcome**:
With these variables configured, when a user logs in via OpenID, LibreChat will request and persist the custom fields from your OpenID provider. This lets you maintain a richer user profile (e.g., tracking their department, role, etc.) in your system.
