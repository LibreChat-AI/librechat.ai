# Agents Configuration (Global)

The root-level `agents` configuration lets administrators control global behaviors for all LibreChat agents—independent of the per-endpoint options defined under `endpoints.agents`.

## Example

```yaml filename="agents"
agents:
  preventFileVersionHistory: true
```

## preventFileVersionHistory

<OptionTable
  options={[
    [
      'preventFileVersionHistory',
      'Boolean',
      'When `true`, attaching files to an agent (e.g., via File Search) no longer creates a new version snapshot of the agent. Defaults to `false` to preserve the previous behavior.',
      'preventFileVersionHistory: true',
    ],
  ]}
/>

**Why disable versioning for file uploads?**

- Prevents the `versions` array from growing uncontrollably when agents ingest large document sets.
- Avoids hitting MongoDB's 16 MB document limit for heavily-used agents.
- Still keeps existing agent state and metadata intact—the setting only skips automatic version snapshots for file attachment updates.

**Notes**

- Applies to all agent file attachments, including File Search/RAG uploads.
- You can still manually capture versions by editing other agent attributes (instructions, tools, etc.).
- Disable this flag if you rely on version history to revert individual file uploads.
