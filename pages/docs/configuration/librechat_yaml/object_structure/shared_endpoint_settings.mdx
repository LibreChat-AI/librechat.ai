# Shared Endpoint Settings

This page describes the shared configuration settings for all endpoints. The settings highlighted here are available to all configurations under the ["Endpoints"](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/config#endpoints) field unless noted otherwise.

## Example Configuration

```yaml filename="Shared Endpoint Settings"
endpoints:
  openAI:
    streamRate: 25
  anthropic:
    streamRate: 25
  google:
    streamRate: 1
  azureOpenAI:
    streamRate: 20
  # the `all` setting would override all the above values, making them unnecessary to be set
  all:
    streamRate: 20
```

## streamRate

**Key:**
<OptionTable
  options={[
    ['streamRate', 'Number', 'The rate at which data is streamed from the endpoint. Useful for controlling the pace of streaming data.', 'streamRate: 25'],
  ]}
/>

**Default:** 1

> Allows for streaming data at the fastest rate possible while allowing the system to wait for the next tick

**Notes:**
- The `all` setting would override all individual endpoint values, making those specific settings unnecessary if used.
- The value can be customized for each endpoint or set globally using the `all` key.
- As of 7/13/24, this setting is not yet available for the assistants endpoints
- Recommended values are between 25-40 for a smooth streaming experience
- Using a higher rate is a must when serving the app to many users at scale.
