**Notes:**

- **Known:** icon provided, fetching list of models is recommended as API token rates and pricing used for token credit balances when models are fetched.

- **Known issue:** 
  - Fetching list of models is not supported.
  - Your success may vary with conversation titling
  - Stream isn't currently supported (but is planned as of April 24, 2024)

<Callout type="tip" title="Fetch and order the models" collapsible>
This python script can fetch and order the llm models for you. The output will be saved in models.txt, formated in a way that should make it easier for you to include in the yaml config.

```py filename="fetch.py"
import json
import requests

def fetch_and_order_models():
    # API endpoint
    url = "https://apipie.ai/models"

    # headers as per request example
    headers = {"Accept": "application/json"}

    # request parameters
    params = {"type": "llm"}

    # make request
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)

    # parse JSON response
    data = response.json()

    # extract an ordered list of unique model IDs
    model_ids = sorted(set([model["id"] for model in data]))

    # write result to a text file
    with open("models.txt", "w") as file:
        json.dump(model_ids, file, indent=2)

# execute the function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    fetch_and_order_models()
```
