# [Openrouter](https://openrouter.ai/)

> OpenRouter API key: [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)

**Notes:**

- **Known:** icon provided, fetching list of models is recommended as API token rates and pricing used for token credit balances when models are fetched.

- `stop` is no longer included as a default parameter, so there is no longer a need to include it in [`dropParams`](./custom_config.md#dropparams), unless you would like to completely prevent users from configuring this field.

- **Known issue:** you should not use `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` as it will then override the `openAI` endpoint to use OpenRouter as well.

```yaml
    - name: "OpenRouter"
      # For `apiKey` and `baseURL`, you can use environment variables that you define.
      # recommended environment variables:
      apiKey: "${OPENROUTER_KEY}" # NOT OPENROUTER_API_KEY
      baseURL: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
      models:
        default: ["meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct"]
        fetch: true
      titleConvo: true
      titleModel: "meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct"
      # Recommended: Drop the stop parameter from the request as Openrouter models use a variety of stop tokens.
      dropParams: ["stop"]
      modelDisplayLabel: "OpenRouter"
```
