# [Cohere](https://cohere.com/)

> Cohere API key: [dashboard.cohere.com](https://dashboard.cohere.com/)

**Notes:**

- **Known:** icon provided.
- Experimental: does not follow OpenAI-spec, uses a new method for endpoint compatibility, shares some similarities and parameters.
- For a full list of Cohere-specific parameters, see the [Cohere API documentation](https://docs.cohere.com/reference/chat).
- Note: The following parameters are recognized between OpenAI and Cohere. Most are removed in the example config below to prefer Cohere's default settings:
    - `stop`: mapped to `stopSequences`
    - `top_p`: mapped to `p`, different min/max values
    - `frequency_penalty`: mapped to `frequencyPenalty`, different min/max values
    - `presence_penalty`: mapped to `presencePenalty`, different min/max values
    - `model`: shared, included by default.
    - `stream`: shared, included by default.
    - `max_tokens`: shared, mapped to `maxTokens`, not included by default.
