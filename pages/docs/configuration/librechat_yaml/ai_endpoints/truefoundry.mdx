title: TrueFoundry AI Gateway
---

TrueFoundry AI Gateway is the proxy layer that sits between your applications and the LLM providers and MCP Servers. It is an enterprise-grade platform that enables users to access 1000+ LLMs using a unified interface while taking care of observability and governance.

## Configuration Details

### Getting Base URL and Model Names

- **Base URL and Model Names**: Get your TrueFoundry AI Gateway endpoint URL and model name from the unified code snippet (ensure you have added the same model name)
- **PAT**: Generate from your TrueFoundry Personal Access Token [PAT](https://docs.truefoundry.com/gateway/authentication#personal-access-token-pat)

## Using TrueFoundry AI Gateway with any LLM model
```yaml filename="librechat.yaml"
      - name: "TrueFoundry"
        apiKey: "${YOUR_PAT}"
        baseURL: "${TRUEFOUNDRY_GATEWAY_URL}"
