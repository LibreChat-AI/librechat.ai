> Perplexity API key: [perplexity.ai/settings/api](https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api)

**Notes:**

- **Known:** icon provided.
- **Known issue:** fetching list of models is not supported.
- API may be strict for some models, and may not allow fields like `stop` and `frequency_penalty` may cause an error when set to 0, in which case, you should use [`dropParams`.](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/object_structure/custom_endpoint#dropparams)
- The example includes a model list, which was last updated on 3 July 2024, for your convenience.
