# Compatible AI Endpoints

## Intro

This section lists known, compatible AI Endpoints with example setups for the `librechat.yaml` file, also known as the [Custom Config](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml) file.

In all of the examples, arbitrary environment variable names are defined but you can use any name you wish, as well as changing the value to `user_provided` to allow users to submit their own API key from the web UI.

Some of the endpoints are marked as **Known,** which means they might have special handling and/or an icon already provided in the app for you.
