# Intro

Welcome to the guide for configuring the **librechat.yaml** file in LibreChat.

This file enables the integration of custom AI endpoints, enabling you to connect with any AI provider compliant with OpenAI API standards.

## Key Features

- **Endpoint Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with a variety of AI providers compliant with OpenAI API standards, including Mistral AI, reverse proxies, and more.
- **Advanced Customization**: Configure file handling, rate limiting, user registration, and interface elements to align with your preferences and requirements.
- **Model Specifications**: Define detailed model configurations, presets, and behaviors to deliver a tailored AI experience.
- **Agents**: Use Provider-agnostic, no-code assistants, with options to customize capabilities.
- **MCP Servers**: Integrate with the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) for tool integrations.
- **Assistants Integration**: Leverage the power of OpenAI's Assistants API, with options to customize capabilities, polling intervals, and timeouts.
- **Azure OpenAI Support**: Integrate with Azure OpenAI Service, enabling access to multiple deployments, region models, and serverless inference endpoints.

Future updates will streamline configuration further by migrating some settings from your [.env file](/docs/configuration/dotenv) to `librechat.yaml`.

Stay tuned for ongoing enhancements to customize your LibreChat instance!

**Note:** To verify your YAML config, you can use the [YAML Validator](/toolkit/yaml_checker) or other online tools like [yamlchecker.com](https://yamlchecker.com/)

<Callout type="error" title="Configuration Validation">
**Important:** LibreChat will exit with an error (exit code 1) if the `librechat.yaml` configuration file contains validation errors. This fail-fast behavior helps catch configuration issues early and prevents running with unintended default settings.

If you need to temporarily bypass validation (e.g., while debugging configuration issues), you can set the `CONFIG_BYPASS_VALIDATION=true` environment variable. This will log a warning and continue with default configuration, preserving the legacy behavior.

```bash filename=".env"
CONFIG_BYPASS_VALIDATION=true
```

> ⚠️ **Note:** Using `CONFIG_BYPASS_VALIDATION=true` is not recommended for production. Fix your configuration errors instead.
</Callout>
