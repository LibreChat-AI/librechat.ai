# Setup

**The `librechat.yaml` file should be placed in the root of the project where the .env file is located.**

You can copy the [example config file](/docs/configuration/librechat_yaml/example) as a good starting point while reading the rest of the guide.

The example config file has some options ready to go for Mistral AI, Groq and Openrouter.

**Note:** You can set an alternate filepath for the `librechat.yaml` file through an environment variable:

```bash filename=".env"
CONFIG_PATH="/alternative/path/to/librechat.yaml"
```

## Docker Setup

For Docker, you need to make use of an [override file](./docker_override.md), named `docker-compose.override.yml`, to ensure the config file works for you.

- First, make sure your containers stop running with `docker compose down`
- Create or edit existing `docker-compose.override.yml` at the root of the project:



```yaml filename="docker-compose.override.yml"
version: '3.4'

services:
    api:
    volumes:
        - ./librechat.yaml:/app/librechat.yaml
```

- **Note:** If you are using `CONFIG_PATH` for an alternative filepath for this file, make sure to specify it accordingly.

- Start docker again, and you should see your config file settings apply

```bash filename="Restart the containers"
docker compose up
```
