# Terms of Service - i18n

## Introduction

LibreChat now supports multi-language functionality for the **Terms of Service**. This guide will help you configure multi-language support for your LibreChat instance, allowing users to view Terms of Service in their preferred language.

### Key Features

* Display Terms of Service in multiple languages.
* Dynamic language switching based on user preferences.
* Seamless integration with existing LibreChat functionality.


## Prerequisites

* You must have a working instance of LibreChat.
* The latest version of LibreChat that includes multi-language support.
* Docker installed (if using a Docker-based setup).


## Step 1: Preparing Your Environment

### Updating LibreChat

Make sure your LibreChat instance is up to date. Pull the latest changes from the LibreChat repository:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

If using Docker, make sure to update your Docker images:

```bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```


## Step 2: Multi-Language Configuration

### 1. Adding Terms of Service Files

The multi-language support requires Markdown files for each language. These files are stored in the `terms` directory.

The following files are currently supported:

* `terms_en.md` (English)
* `terms_de.md` (German)
* `terms_fr.md` (French)

To add a new language:

1. Create a new Markdown file in the `terms` directory, named as `terms_<language-code>.md`.
2. Populate the file with the translated Terms of Service.
3. **Update the Language Mapping** in `client/src/utils/termsContent.ts`:

* Add an import statement for the new language:

```javascript
import terms_nl from '../../../terms/terms_nl.md?raw';
```
* Add the new language to the `markdownMap` object:

```javascript
const markdownMap: Record<string, string> = {
  en: terms_en,
  de: terms_de,
  fr: terms_fr,
  nl: terms_nl // Added Dutch language support
};
```

    <Callout type="warning" title="Important" emoji="⚠️">
        The file name should follow the format: `terms_<language-code>.md`, and the `markdownMap` object must be updated with the new language for it to work.
    </Callout>


### 2. Updating Docker Configuration

Make sure your Docker setup mounts the `terms` directory:

```yaml
services:
  client:
    volumes:
      - ./terms:/app/terms
```

Restart the Docker containers to apply the changes:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```


## Step 3: Verifying the Setup

After configuring the multi-language support, follow these steps to verify:

1. Access LibreChat from a browser.
2. Open the **Terms of Service** modal.
3. Change the language in the UI.
4. Verify that the Terms of Service content changes accordingly.



## Troubleshooting

### Terms Not Changing Language

* Ensure that the markdown files are correctly named and placed in the `terms` directory.
* Verify the language codes match the file names (e.g., `terms_de.md` for German).
* Make sure the new language is added to the `markdownMap` in `client/src/utils/termsContent.ts`.
* Restart the Docker containers after making changes.

### Missing Language Support

* Verify that the file exists in the `terms` directory.
* Ensure that you have imported and added the language in the `markdownMap` object in `termsContent.ts`.
