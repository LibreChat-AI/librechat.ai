# Speech to Text (STT) and Text to Speech (TTS)

<Callout type="info" title="Upcoming STT/TTS Enhancements" collapsible>

The Google cloud STT/TTS and Deepgram services are beeing planned to add in the future

</Callout>

## STT

The Speech-to-Text (STT) feature allows you to convert spoken words into written text.
To enable the STT (already configured), click on the STT button (near the send button) and start speaking. Otherwise, you can also use the key combination: ++Ctrl+Alt+L++ to start the transcription.

There are many different STT services available, but here's a list of some of the most popular ones:

### Local STT

- Browser-based
- Whisper (tested on LocalAI and HomeAssistant)

### Cloud STT

- OpenAI Whisper (via API calls)
- Azure Whisper (via API calls)
- All the other OpenAI compatible STT services (via API calls)

### Browser-based

No setup required, just click make sure that the "STT button" in the speech settings tab is enabled and in the engine dropdown "Browser" is selected. When clicking the button, the browser will ask for permission to use the microphone. Once permission is granted, you can start speaking and the text will be displayed in the chat window in real-time. When you're done speaking, click the button again to stop the transcription or wait for the timeout to stop the transcription automatically

### Whisper local

<Callout type="warning" title="Compatibility Testing" collapsible>

Whisper local has been tested only on LocalAI and HomeAssistant's whisper docker image, but it should work on any other local whisper instance

</Callout>

To use the Whisper local STT service, you need to have a local whisper instance running. You can find more information on how to set up a local whisper instance with LocalAI in the [LocalAI's documentation](https://localai.io/features/audio-to-text/). Once you have a local whisper instance running, you can configure the STT service as followed:

in the `librechat.yaml` add this configuration:

```yaml
stt:
  openai:
    url: 'http://localhost:8080/v1/audio/transcriptions'
    model: 'whisper'
```

where, `url` it's the url of the whisper instance, the apiKey points to the .env and `model` is the model that you want to use for the transcription

### OpenAI Whisper

Create an OpenAI api key at [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

Then, in the `librechat.yaml` file, add the following configuration:

```yaml
stt:
  openai:
    apiKey: '${STT_API_KEY}'
    model: 'whisper-1'
```

<Callout type="abstract" title="Understanding Guide" collapsible>

if you want to understand more about these variables check the [Whisper local](#whisper-local) section

</Callout>

### Azure Whisper (WIP)

in the `librechat.yaml` file, add the following configuration to your already existing Azure configuration:

??? info "don't have an Azure configuration yet?"
if you don't have one, you can find more information on how to set up an Azure STT service in the [Azure's documentation](https://docs.librechat.ai/install/configuration/azure_openai.html)

<Callout type="i" title="don't have an Azure configuration yet?" collapsible>

if you don't have one, you can find more information on how to set up an Azure STT service in the [Azure's documentation](https://docs.librechat.ai/install/configuration/azure_openai.html)

</Callout>

```yaml filename="librechat.yaml"
models:
  whisper:
    deploymentName: whisper-01
```

<Callout type="abstract" title="Understanding Guide" collapsible>

if you want to understand more about these variables check the [Whisper local](#whisper-local) section

</Callout>

### OpenAI compatible STT services

check the [OpenAI Whisper](#openai-whisper) section, just change the `url` and `model` variables to the ones that you want to use


## TTS

The Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature allows you to convert written text into spoken words. There are many different TTS services available, but here's a list of some of the most popular ones:

### Local TTS

- Browser-based
- Piper (tested on LocalAI)
- Coqui (tested on LocalAI)

### Cloud TTS

- OpenAI TTS
- ElevenLabs
- All the other OpenAI compatible TTS services

### Piper

<Callout type="warning" title="Compatibility Testing" collapsible>

Piper has been tested only on LocalAI, but it should work on any other local piper instance

</Callout>

To use the Piper local TTS service, you need to have a local piper instance running. You can find more information on how to set up a local piper instance with LocalAI in the [LocalAI's documentation](https://localai.io/features/text-to-audio/#piper). Once you have a local piper instance running, you can configure the TTS service as followed:

in the `librechat.yaml` add this configuration:

```yaml filename="librechat.yaml"
tts:
  localai:
    url: 'http://localhost:8080/v1/audio/synthesize'
    voices: ['it-riccardo_fasol-x-low.onnx', 'voice-1.onnx', 'voice-2.onnx']
    backend: 'piper'
```

voices are just an example, you can find more information about the voices in the [LocalAI's documentation](https://localai.io/features/text-to-audio/#piper)

### Coqui

<Callout type="warning" title="Compatibility Testing" collapsible>

Coqui has been tested only on LocalAI, but it should work on any other local coqui instance

</Callout>

To use the Coqui local TTS service, you need to have a local coqui instance running. You can find more information on how to set up a local coqui instance with LocalAI in the [LocalAI's documentation](https://localai.io/features/text-to-audio/#-coqui). Once you have a local coqui instance running, you can configure the TTS service as followed:

in the `librechat.yaml` add this configuration:

```yaml filename="librechat.yaml"
tts:
  localai:
    url: 'http://localhost:8080/v1/audio/synthesize'
    voices: ['tts_models/en/ljspeech/glow-tts', 'tts_models/en/ljspeech/tacotron2', 'tts_models/en/ljspeech/waveglow']
    backend: 'coqui'
```

voices are just an example, you can find more information about the voices in the [LocalAI's documentation](https://localai.io/features/text-to-audio/#-coqui)

### OpenAI TTS

Create an OpenAI api key at [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

Then, in the `librechat.yaml` file, add the following configuration:

```yaml filename="librechat.yaml"
tts:
  openai:
    apiKey: '${TTS_API_KEY}'
    model: 'tts-1'
    voice: ['alloy', 'echo', 'fable', 'onyx', 'nova', 'shimmer']

### ElevenLabs

Create an ElevenLabs api key at [ElevenLabs's website](https://elevenlabs.io/)

Then, click on the "Voices" tab, and copy the ID of the voices you want to use. If you haven't already added one, click on the "Voice library" where you can find a lot of pre-made voices, add one and copy the ID of the voice that you want to use by clicking the "ID" button

in the `librechat.yaml` file, add the following configuration:

```yaml filename="librechat.yaml"
tts:
  elevenlabs:
    apiKey: '${TTS_API_KEY}'

    voices: ['202898wioas09d2', 'addwqr324tesfsf', '3asdasr3qrq44w', 'adsadsa']
```

where the model is the model that you want to use for the synthesis (not the voice), you can find more information about the models in the [ElevenLabs's documentation](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/get-models) and `voices` is the ID of all the voices you want to add

if you want to add custom parameters, you can add them in the `librechat.yaml` file as follows:

<Callout type="warning" title="only for ElevenLabs" collapsible>

these parameters under the `voice_settings` and the pronunciation_dictionary_locators are only for ElevenLabs
