# Speech to Text (STT) and Text to Speech (TTS)

<Callout type="info" title="Upcoming STT/TTS Enhancements" collapsible>

The Google cloud STT/TTS and Deepgram services are beeing planned to add in the future

</Callout>

## STT

The Speech-to-Text (STT) feature allows you to convert spoken words into written text.
To enable the STT (already configured), click on the STT button (near the send button) and start speaking. Otherwise, you can also use the key combination: ++Ctrl+Alt+L++ to start the transcription.

There are many different STT services available, but here's a list of some of the most popular ones:

### Local STT

- Browser-based
- Whisper (tested on LocalAI and HomeAssistant)

### Cloud STT

- OpenAI Whisper (via API calls)
- Azure Whisper (via API calls)
- All the other OpenAI compatible STT services (via API calls)

### Browser-based

No setup required, just click make sure that the "STT button" in the speech settings tab is enabled and in the engine dropdown "Browser" is selected. When clicking the button, the browser will ask for permission to use the microphone. Once permission is granted, you can start speaking and the text will be displayed in the chat window in real-time. When you're done speaking, click the button again to stop the transcription or wait for the timeout to stop the transcription automatically

### Whisper local

<Callout type="warning" title="Compatibility Testing" collapsible>

Whisper local has been tested only on LocalAI and HomeAssistant's whisper docker image, but it should work on any other local whisper instance

</Callout>

To use the Whisper local STT service, you need to have a local whisper instance running. You can find more information on how to set up a local whisper instance with LocalAI in the [LocalAI's documentation](https://localai.io/features/audio-to-text/). Once you have a local whisper instance running, you can configure the STT service as followed:

in the `librechat.yaml` add this configuration:

```yaml
stt:
  openai:
    url: 'http://host.docker.internal:8080/v1/audio/transcriptions'
    model: 'whisper'
```

where, `url` it's the url of the whisper instance, the apiKey points to the .env and `model` is the model that you want to use for the transcription

### OpenAI Whisper

Create an OpenAI api key at [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

Then, in the `librechat.yaml` file, add the following configuration:

```yaml
stt:
  openai:
    apiKey: '${STT_API_KEY}'
    model: 'whisper-1'
```

<Callout type="abstract" title="Understanding Guide" collapsible>

if you want to understand more about these variables check the [Whisper local](#whisper-local) section

</Callout>

### Azure Whisper (WIP)

in the `librechat.yaml` file, add the following configuration to your already existing Azure configuration:

<Callout type="i" title="don't have an Azure configuration yet?" collapsible>

if you don't have one, you can find more information on how to set up an Azure STT service in the [Azure's documentation](https://docs.librechat.ai/install/configuration/azure_openai.html)

</Callout>

```yaml filename="librechat.yaml"
models:
  whisper:
    deploymentName: whisper-01
```

<Callout type="abstract" title="Understanding Guide" collapsible>

if you want to understand more about these variables check the [Whisper local](#whisper-local) section

```yaml filename="librechat.yaml"
tts:
  localai:
    url: "http://host.docker.internal:8080/tts"
    apiKey: "EMPTY"
    voices: [
      "en-us-amy-low.onnx",
