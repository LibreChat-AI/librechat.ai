# Speech to Text (STT) and Text to Speech (TTS)

<Callout type="info" title="Upcoming STT/TTS Enhancements" collapsible>

The Google cloud STT/TTS and Deepgram services are beeing planned to add in the future

</Callout>

## STT

The Speech-to-Text (STT) feature allows you to convert spoken words into written text.
To enable the STT (already configured), click on the STT button (near the send button) and start speaking. Otherwise, you can also use the key combination: ++Ctrl+Alt+L++ to start the transcription.

There are many different STT services available, but here's a list of some of the most popular ones:

### Local STT

- Browser-based
- Whisper (tested on LocalAI and HomeAssistant)

### Cloud STT

- OpenAI Whisper (via API calls)
- Azure Whisper (via API calls)
- All the other OpenAI compatible STT services

### Browser-based

No setup required, just click make sure that the "STT button" in the speech settings tab is enabled. When clicking the button, the browser will ask for permission to use the microphone. Once permission is granted, you can start speaking and the text will be displayed in the chat window in real-time. When you're done speaking, click the button again to stop the transcription or wait for the timeout to stop the transcription automatically

### Whisper local

<Callout type="warning" title="Compatibility Testing" collapsible>

Whisper local has been tested only on LocalAI and HomeAssistant's whisper docker image, but it should work on any other local whisper instance

</Callout>

To use the Whisper local STT service, you need to have a local whisper instance running. You can find more information on how to set up a local whisper instance with LocalAI in the [LocalAI's documentation](https://localai.io/features/audio-to-text/). Once you have a local whisper instance running, you can configure the STT service as followed:

in the `librechat.yaml` add this configuration:

```yaml
stt:
  url: 'http://localhost:8080/v1/audio/transcriptions'
  apiKey: '${STT_API_KEY}'
  model: 'whisper'
```

where, the url it's the url of the whisper instance, the apiKey points to the .env (you need to use the .env necessarly), put a random string if (in the case of LocalAI) you don't have an api, and the model is the model that you want to use for the transcription.

in the `.env` file add a random string for the `STT_API_KEY` variable

```bash filename=".env"
STT_API_KEY=sk-1234
```

### OpenAI Whisper

Create an OpenAI api key at [OpenAI's website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and add it to the `.env` file as follows:

```bash filename=".env"
STT_API_KEY=sk-1234
```

Then, in the `librechat.yaml` file, add the following configuration:

```yaml
stt:
  url: 'https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions'
  apiKey: '${STT_API_KEY}'
  model: 'whisper'
```

### Azure Whisper

Add a random string to the `STT_API_KEY` variable in the `.env` file:

```bash filename=".env"
STT_API_KEY=sk-1234
```

Then, in the `librechat.yaml` file, add the following configuration to your already existing Azure configuration:

??? info "don't have an Azure configuration yet?"
if you don't have one, you can find more information on how to set up an Azure STT service in the [Azure's documentation](https://docs.librechat.ai/install/configuration/azure_openai.html)

```yaml
models:
  whisper:
    deploymentName: whisper-01
```

Then, in the `librechat.yaml` file, add the following configuration:

```bash filename=".env"
TTS_API_KEY=sk-1234
```

Then, in the `librechat.yaml` file, add the following configuration:

```yaml
tts:
  url: 'https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/synthesize'
  apiKey: '${TTS_API_KEY}'
  model: 'tts'
  voice: 'alloy'
```

you can choose between the `tts-1` and the `tts-1-hd` models, more information about the models can be found in the [OpenAI's documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech/audio-quality)

the `voice` variable can be `alloy`, `echo`, `fable` etc... more information about the voices can be found in the [OpenAI's documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech/voice-options)

### ElevenLabs

Create an ElevenLabs api key at [ElevenLabs's website](https://elevenlabs.io/) and add it to the `.env` file as follows:

```bash filename=".env"

  apiKey: '${TTS_API_KEY}'
  model: 'eleven_monolingual_v1'
  compatibility: 'elevenlabs'
```

where the model is the model that you want to use for the synthesis (not the voice), you can find more information about the models in the [ElevenLabs's documentation](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/get-models) and the voice-id is the ID of the voice that you want to use

if you want to add custom parameters, you can add them in the `librechat.yaml` file as follows:

<Callout type="warning" title="only for ElevenLabs" collapsible>

these parameters under the `voice_settings` and the pronunciation_dictionary_locators are only for ElevenLabs

</Callout>
