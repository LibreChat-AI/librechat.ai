### General

![Active users in LibreChat](/images/metrics/librechat-metrics-active-users.png)

You can use Prometheus or any other OpenMetrics compatible monitoring tool to get metrics about active usage of LibreChat.
This includes technical information like the usage of tokens,
but also information about end users like the number of total or active users.

The metrics exporter is available at [virtUOS/librechat_exporter](https://github.com/virtUOS/librechat_exporter).
It is a separate tool you deploy alongside LibreChat.

### Setup

To deploy the exporter, just add the necessary container to your compose configuration like this:

```yaml
  metrics:
    image: ghcr.io/virtuos/librechat_exporter:main
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

You can optionally also configure the exporter.
But usually, the defaults should be just fine.
```yaml
    environment:
      - MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongodb:27017/
      - LOGGING_LEVEL=info
```

### Usage

You can now add the exporter to your Prometheus scrape configuration:
```yaml
- job_name: librechat
  static_configs:
    - targets:
        - 'librechat.example.com:8000'
```

Once scraping the metrics has started, look for `librechat_*` metrics (e.g., `librechat_registered_users`).
The exporter provides several metrics.
