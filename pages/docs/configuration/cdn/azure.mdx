## Production Setup

Azure Blob Storage offers scalable, secure object storage that can be used as a CDN for your static assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript. Follow these steps to configure your Azure Blob Storage for LibreChat.

## 1. Create an Azure Storage Account

1. **Sign in to Azure:**
   - Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in with your Microsoft account.

2. **Create a Storage Account:**
   - Click on **"Create a resource"** and search for **"Storage account"**.
   - Click **"Create"** and fill in the required details:
     - **Subscription & Resource Group:** Choose your subscription and either select an existing resource group or create a new one.
     - **Storage Account Name:** Enter a unique name (e.g., `mylibrechatstorage`).
     - **Region:** Select the region closest to your users.
     - **Performance & Redundancy:** Choose the performance tier and redundancy level that best suit your needs.
   - Click **"Review + Create"** and then **"Create"**. Wait until the deployment completes.

## 2. Set Up Authentication

You have two options for authenticating with your Azure Storage Account:

### Option A: Using a Connection String

1. **Navigate to Access Keys:**
   - In your newly created storage account, go to **"Access keys"** in the sidebar.

2. **Copy Connection String:**
   - Copy one of the connection strings provided. This string includes the credentials required to connect to your Blob Storage account.

### Option B: Using Managed Identity

If your LibreChat application is running on an Azure service that supports Managed Identity (such as an Azure VM, App Service, Container Apps, or AKS), you can use that instead of a connection string.

1. **Assign Managed Identity:**
   - Ensure your Azure resource (VM, App Service, Container Apps, or AKS) has a system-assigned or user-assigned Managed Identity enabled.

2. **Grant Storage Permissions:**
   - In your storage account, assign the following roles to your Managed Identity:
     - **Storage Blob Data Contributor** - Required for reading and writing blobs
     - **Storage Blob Delegator** - Required for generating User Delegation SAS tokens (only needed when `AZURE_STORAGE_PUBLIC_ACCESS=false`)

## 3. Update Your Environment Variables

Create or update your `.env` file in your project's root with the following configuration:

```bash filename=".env"
# Option A: Using a Connection String
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=yourAccountName;AccountKey=yourAccountKey;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net

# Option B: Using Managed Identity (do not set the connection string if using Managed Identity)
AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=yourAccountName

AZURE_STORAGE_PUBLIC_ACCESS=false
AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME=files

# Optional: URL signing configuration (only applies when AZURE_STORAGE_PUBLIC_ACCESS=false)
# Recommended: 3600 (1 hour) for typical usage
AZURE_URL_EXPIRY_SECONDS=3600
```

- **AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING:** Set this if you are using Option A.
- **AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME:** Set this if you are using Option B (Managed Identity). Do not set both.
- **AZURE_STORAGE_PUBLIC_ACCESS:** Set to `false` if you do not want your blobs to be publicly accessible by default. Set to `true` if you need public access (for example, for publicly viewable images).
- **AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME:** This is the container name your application will use (e.g., `files`). The application will automatically create this container if it doesn't exist.
- **AZURE_URL_EXPIRY_SECONDS:** Controls how long signed URLs remain valid (default: 120 seconds, max: 7 days). See URL Signing Configuration below.

### URL Signing Configuration (Optional)

When `AZURE_STORAGE_PUBLIC_ACCESS` is set to `false`, LibreChat automatically generates signed URLs (SAS tokens) for secure file access. You can configure how long these URLs remain valid:

```bash filename=".env"
# URL expiry time in seconds (default: 120 seconds, max: 7 days)
# Recommended values:
#   - 3600 (1 hour) - Good balance of security and usability
#   - 7200 (2 hours) - For longer sessions
#   - 86400 (1 day) - For minimal refresh overhead
AZURE_URL_EXPIRY_SECONDS=3600
```

**How URL refresh works:**

- LibreChat automatically refreshes signed URLs before they expire
- The refresh check is cached per user for half the expiry time (minimum 1 minute) to avoid excessive database updates
- For example, with a 1-hour expiry, refresh checks occur at most every 30 minutes per user
- User avatars and file attachments are both automatically refreshed

<Callout type="warning" title="Short Expiry Times">
  Setting `AZURE_URL_EXPIRY_SECONDS` to very short values (under 300 seconds) may cause images to expire before they can be refreshed, resulting in broken images. We recommend at least 3600 seconds (1 hour) for production use.
</Callout>

**Signing method selection:**

LibreChat automatically selects the appropriate signing method based on your configuration:

- When `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` is set: Uses **Account Key signing** (extracts the key from the connection string)
- When only `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` is set: Uses **User Delegation SAS** via Managed Identity

<Callout type="info" title="Managed Identity Requirements">
  User Delegation SAS requires the `Storage Blob Delegator` role in addition to `Storage Blob Data Contributor` on your Managed Identity. The delegation key is cached for 7 days and automatically refreshed.
</Callout>

**Switching between public and private access:**

If you change `AZURE_STORAGE_PUBLIC_ACCESS` after files have been uploaded:
- **Public → Private:** Existing plain URLs will be signed on the next refresh cycle
- **Private → Public:** Signed URLs will be converted to plain URLs when they expire or on the next refresh

## 4. Configure LibreChat to Use Azure Blob Storage

Update your LibreChat configuration file (`librechat.yaml`) to specify that the application should use Azure Blob Storage for file handling:

```yaml filename="librechat.yaml"
version: 1.2.8
cache: true
fileStrategy: "azure_blob"
```

This setting tells LibreChat to use the Azure Blob Storage implementation provided in your code.

## Summary

1. **Create a Storage Account:**  
Sign in to the Azure Portal, create a storage account, and wait for deployment to finish.

2. **Set Up Authentication:**
- **Option A:** Retrieve the connection string from **"Access keys"** in your storage account.
- **Option B:** Use Managed Identity by enabling it on your Azure resource and granting it `Storage Blob Data Contributor` and `Storage Blob Delegator` roles.

3. **Update Environment Variables:**  
In your `.env` file, set either:
- `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` (for Option A), or
- `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` (for Option B), along with:
- `AZURE_STORAGE_PUBLIC_ACCESS`
- `AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME`
- `AZURE_URL_EXPIRY_SECONDS` (optional, for signed URL expiry control)

4. **Configure LibreChat:**  
Set `fileStrategy` to `"azure_blob"` in your `librechat.yaml` configuration file.

With these steps, your LibreChat application will automatically create the container (if it doesn't exist) and manage file uploads, downloads, and deletions using Azure Blob Storage as your CDN. Managed Identity provides a secure alternative by eliminating the need for long-term credentials.

## Local Development with Azurite

For local development and testing, you can use [Azurite](https://github.com/Azure/Azurite), an Azure Storage emulator that provides a local environment for testing your Azure Blob Storage integration without needing an actual Azure account.

### 1. Set Up Azurite

You can run Azurite in several ways:

#### Option A: Using VS Code Extension (Recommended for Development)

1. Install the [Azurite extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Azurite.azurite) for VS Code
2. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P)
3. Search for and select "Azurite: Start"

This will start Azurite in the background with default settings.

#### Option B: Using Docker

```bash
docker run -p 10000:10000 -p 10001:10001 -p 10002:10002 mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite
```

#### Option C: Using npm

```bash
npm install -g azurite
azurite --silent --location /path/to/azurite/workspace --debug /path/to/debug/log
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables for Local Development

Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```bash filename=".env"
# Azurite connection string for local development
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http;AccountName=devstoreaccount1;AccountKey=Eby8vdM02xNOcqFlqUwJPLlmEtlCDXJ1OUzFT50uSRZ6IFsuFq2UVErCz4I6tq/K1SZFPTOtr/KBHBeksoGMGw==;BlobEndpoint=http://127.0.0.1:10000/devstoreaccount1;"

# Use public access for simpler local testing
AZURE_STORAGE_PUBLIC_ACCESS=true
AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME=files

# Or test with signed URLs locally (requires connection string)
# AZURE_STORAGE_PUBLIC_ACCESS=false
# AZURE_URL_EXPIRY_SECONDS=300
```

Notes:
- The `AccountKey` value is the default development key used by Azurite
- The connection uses `http` protocol instead of `https` for local development
- The `BlobEndpoint` points to the local Azurite instance running on port 10000
- Signed URLs work with Azurite when using the connection string

<Callout type="info" title="Testing Signed URLs Locally">
  To test signed URL functionality locally, set `AZURE_STORAGE_PUBLIC_ACCESS=false` and use the connection string. Managed Identity (User Delegation SAS) cannot be tested locally as it requires Azure infrastructure.
</Callout>

### 3. Verify the Connection

To verify that your application can connect to the local Azurite instance:

1. Start your LibreChat application
2. Attempt to upload a file through the interface
3. Check the Azurite logs to confirm the connection and operations

If you're using the VS Code extension, you can view the Azurite logs in the Output panel by selecting "Azurite Blob" from the dropdown.

<Callout type="info" title="Note">
  The default Azurite account key is a fixed value used for development purposes only. Never use this key in production environments. Always ensure that your connection string remains secure and never commit it to a public repository.
