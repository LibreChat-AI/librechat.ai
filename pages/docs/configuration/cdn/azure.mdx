# Azure Blob Storage CDN Setup

Azure Blob Storage offers scalable, secure object storage that can be used as a CDN for your static assets such as images, CSS, and JavaScript. Follow these steps to configure your Azure Blob Storage for LibreChat.


## 1. Create an Azure Storage Account

1. **Sign in to Azure:**
Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and sign in with your Microsoft account.

2. **Create a Storage Account:**
- Click on **"Create a resource"** and search for **"Storage account"**.
- Click **"Create"** and fill in the required details:
- **Subscription & Resource Group:** Choose your subscription and either select an existing resource group or create a new one.
- **Storage Account Name:** Enter a unique name (e.g., `mylibrechatstorage`).
- **Region:** Select the region closest to your users.
- **Performance & Redundancy:** Choose the performance tier and redundancy level that best suit your needs.
- Click **"Review + Create"** and then **"Create"**. Wait until the deployment completes.


## 2. Get Your Connection String

1. **Navigate to Access Keys:**
In your newly created storage account, go to **"Access keys"** in the sidebar.

2. **Copy Connection String:**
Copy one of the connection strings provided. This string includes the credentials required to connect to your Blob Storage account.


## 3. Update Your Environment Variables

Create or update your `.env` file in your project’s root with the following configuration:

```bash filename=".env"
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=yourAccountName;AccountKey=yourAccountKey;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net
AZURE_STORAGE_PUBLIC_ACCESS=false
AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME=files
```

- **AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING:** Replace `yourAccountName` and `yourAccountKey` with the actual values from your storage account.
- **AZURE_STORAGE_PUBLIC_ACCESS:** Set to `false` if you do not want your blobs to be publicly accessible by default. Set to `true` if you need public access (for example, for publicly viewable images).
- **AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME:** This is the container name your application will use (e.g., `files`). The application will automatically create this container if it doesn’t exist.


## 4. Configure LibreChat to Use Azure Blob Storage

Update your LibreChat configuration file (`librechat.yaml`) to specify that the application should use Azure Blob Storage for file handling:

```yaml filename="librechat.yaml"
version: 1.0.8
cache: true
fileStrategy: "azure"
```

This setting tells LibreChat to use the Azure Blob Storage implementation provided in your code.

## Summary

1. **Create a Storage Account:** Sign in to the Azure Portal, create a storage account, and wait for deployment to finish.
2. **Retrieve the Connection String:** Go to **"Access keys"** in your storage account and copy the connection string.
3. **Update Environment Variables:** In your `.env` file, set:
 - `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` with your connection string.
 - `AZURE_STORAGE_PUBLIC_ACCESS` to `false` (or `true` if public access is needed).
 - `AZURE_CONTAINER_NAME` with your desired container name.
4. **Configure LibreChat:** Set `fileStrategy` to `"azure"` in your `librechat.yaml` file.

With these steps, your LibreChat application will automatically create the container (if it doesn’t exist) and manage file uploads, downloads, and deletions using Azure Blob Storage.

  Always ensure that your connection string remains secure and never commit it to a public repository. Adjust the public access setting as needed based on your application’s security requirements.
