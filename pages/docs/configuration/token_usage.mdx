# Token Usage

## Intro

As of `v0.6.0`, LibreChat accurately tracks token usage for the OpenAI/Plugins endpoints. All token transactions are stored in the "Transactions" collection in your database. In future releases, you’ll be able to toggle viewing how much a conversation costs.

Currently, you can limit user token usage by enabling user balances. Instead of configuring token credit limits via environment variables, you now set these options in your `librechat.yaml` file under the **balance** section.

### New Balance Settings

The following settings are now managed in your YAML configuration:

- **enabled**: Enable token credit balances for the OpenAI/Plugins endpoints.
- **startBalance**: The number of tokens credited to a user upon registration.

This replaces the old environment variables (`CHECK_BALANCE` and `START_BALANCE`), so you no longer need to manage these settings in your environment.

```yaml filename="librechat.yaml"
version: 1.2.1

# Balance settings
balance:
  enabled: true               # Enable token credit balances for users.
  startBalance: 20000         # Number of tokens to credit upon registration.
```

## Managing Token Balances

You can manually add or set user balances. This is especially useful during development or if you plan to build out a full balance-accruing system in the future (for example, via an admin dashboard).

### Adding Balances

```bash filename="To manually add balances, run the following command:"
# Local Development
npm run add-balance

# Docker (default setup)
docker-compose exec api npm run add-balance

# Docker (deployment setup)
docker exec -it LibreChat-API /bin/sh -c "cd .. && npm run add-balance"
```

```bash filename="You can also specify the email and token credit amount to add, e.g.:"
# Local Development
npm run add-balance danny@librechat.ai 1000

# Docker (default setup)
docker-compose exec api npm run add-balance danny@librechat.ai 1000

# Docker (deployment setup)
docker exec -it LibreChat-API /bin/sh -c "cd .. && npm run add-balance danny@librechat.ai 1000"
```

### Setting Balances

Additionally, you can set a balance for a user. An existing balance will be overwritten by the new balance.

```bash filename="To manually set balances, run the following command:"
# Local Development
npm run set-balance

# Docker (default setup)
docker-compose exec api npm run set-balance

# Docker (deployment setup)
docker exec -it LibreChat-API /bin/sh -c "cd .. && npm run set-balance"
```

```bash filename="You can also specify the email and token credit amount to set, e.g.:"
# Local Development
npm run set-balance danny@librechat.ai 1000

# Docker (default setup)
docker-compose exec api npm run set-balance danny@librechat.ai 1000

# Docker (deployment setup)
docker exec -it LibreChat-API /bin/sh -c "cd .. && npm run set-balance danny@librechat.ai 1000"
```

### Listing of balances

```bash filename="To see the balances of your users, you can run:"
# Local Development
npm run list-balances

# Docker (default setup)
docker-compose exec api npm run list-balances

# Docker (deployment setup)
docker exec -it LibreChat-API /bin/sh -c "cd .. && npm run list-balances"
```

This works well to track your own usage for personal use; 1000 credits = $0.001 (1 mill USD)

## Notes

- With summarization enabled, you will be blocked from making an API request if the cost of the content that you need to summarize + your messages payload exceeds the current balance
- Counting Prompt tokens is really accurate for OpenAI calls, but not 100% for plugins (due to function calling). It is really close and conservative, meaning its count may be higher by 2-5 tokens.
- The system allows deficits incurred by the completion tokens. It only checks if you have enough for the prompt Tokens, and is pretty lenient with the completion. The graph below details the logic
- The above said, plugins are checked at each generation step, since the process works with multiple API calls. Anything the LLM has generated since the initial user prompt is shared to the user in the error message as seen below.
- There is a 150 token buffer for titling since this is a 2 step process, that averages around 200 total tokens. In the case of insufficient funds, the titling is cancelled before any spend happens and no error is thrown.

## More details
source: [LibreChat/discussions/1640](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/discussions/1640#discussioncomment-8251970)

> "rawAmount": -000, // what's this?

Raw amount of tokens as counted per the tokenizer algorithm.

>    "tokenValue": -00000, // what's this?

Token credits value. 1000 credits = $0.001 (1 mill USD)

> "rate": 00, // what's this?

The rate at which tokens are charged as credits.

For example, gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 has a rate of 1 for user prompt (input) and 2 for completion (output)

| Model                 | Input                | Output               |
|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| gpt-3.5-turbo-1106    | $0.0010 / 1K tokens  | $0.0020 / 1K tokens  |


Given the provided example:
```sh
    "rawAmount": -137
    "tokenValue": -205.5
    "rate": 1.5
```

```math
\text{Token Value} = (\text{Raw Amount of Tokens}) \times (\text{Rate})
```

```math
137 \times 1.5 = 205.5
```

And to get the real amount of USD spend based on **Token Value**:

```math
\frac{\text{Token Value}}{1,000,000} = \left(\frac{\text{Raw Amount of Tokens} \times \text{Rate}}{1,000,000}\right)
```

```math
\frac{205.5}{1,000,000} = \$0.0002055 \text{ USD}
```

The relevant file for editing rates is found in `api/models/tx.js`

There will be more customization for this soon from the `librechat.yaml` file.

## How Auto-Refill Works

When a user’s balance is tracked and **autoRefill** is enabled, the system will automatically add credits to the balance only when the specified time interval has passed since the last refill. This is achieved by comparing the current date with the `lastRefill` date plus the specified interval. For example, if `refillIntervalValue` is set to 30 and `refillIntervalUnit` is `days`, the system will add `refillAmount` tokens to the user’s balance only if 30 days have passed since the last refill.

## Additional Notes

- With summarization enabled, API requests are blocked if the cost of the content plus the messages payload exceeds the current balance.
- The system is lenient with completion tokens, focusing primarily on prompt tokens for balance checks.
- A buffer is added for titling (approximately 150 tokens) to account for the two-step process.
- Token credits translate to monetary value (e.g., 1000 credits = $0.001 USD).
