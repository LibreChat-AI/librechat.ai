# Locally test the app during development

## Local Unit Tests

Before submitting your updates, it's crucial to verify they pass all unit tests. Follow these steps to run tests locally:

- Copy your `.env.example` file in the `/api` folder and rename it to `.env`

  ```bash filename="create a /api/.env file"
  cp .env.example ./api/.env
  ```

- Add `NODE_ENV=CI` to your `/api/.env` file
- `npm run test:client`
- `npm run test:api`

<Callout type="warning" title="Warning">
  When executed locally, this API unit test is expected to fail. This should be the only error
  encountered.
