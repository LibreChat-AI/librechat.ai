# Plugins Endpoint

![intro-1](https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat/assets/32828263/7db788a5-2173-4115-b34b-43ea132dae69)


The plugins endpoint opens the door to prompting LLMs in new ways other than traditional input/output prompting.

The first step is using chain-of-thought prompting & **["agency"](https://zapier.com/blog/ai-agent/)** for using plugins/tools in a fashion mimicing the official ChatGPT Plugins feature.

More than this, you can use this endpoint for changing your conversation settings mid-conversation. Unlike the official ChatGPT site and all other endpoints, you can switch models, presets, and settings mid-convo, even when you have no plugins selected. This is useful if you first want a creative response from GPT-4, and then a deterministic, lower cost response from GPT-3. Soon, you will be able to use Google, HuggingFace, local models, all in this or a similar endpoint in the same modular manner.

## Using Plugins 

The LLM process when using Plugins is illustrated below.

**When you open the settings with the Plugins endpoint selected, you will view the default settings for the Completion Phase.**

Clicking on **"Show Agent Settings"** will allow you to modify parameters for the thinking phase

- You can specify which plugins you would like to select from by installing/uninstalling them in the Plugin store

## Notes
- Every additional plugin selected will increase your token usage as there are detailed instructions the LLM needs for each one
- For best use, be selective with plugins per message and narrow your requests as much as possible
- If you need help coming up with a good plugin prompt, ask the LLM for suggestions before using one!
- Chain-of-thought prompting (plugin use) will always be more expensive than regular input/output prompting, so be sure it meets your need.
- Currently, the cheapest use will be to use gpt-3.5 for both phases
- From my testing, the best "bang for your buck" will be to use gpt-3.5 for the thinking phase, and gpt-4 for completion.
- Adding to above, if you ask for a poem and an image at the same time, it may work, but both may suffer in quality
  - Instead, ask for a poem first with creative settings
  - Then, ask for a good prompt for Stable Diffusion based on the poem
  - Finally, use the Stable Diffusion plugin by referencing the pre-generated prompt
- Presets are only available when no Plugins are selected as the final review of the thinking phase has a specific system message.
